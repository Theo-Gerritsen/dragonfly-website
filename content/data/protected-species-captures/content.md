We developed an interactive website to present data on seabird, marine mammal, and turtle bycatch in New
Zealand waters for the Ministry for Primary Industries.

To monitor the impacts of commercial fishing on seabirds, marine mammals, and turtles, government observers on fishing vessels record any catch incidents that occur. Data on the capture of these protected species in trawl and longline fisheries from 2002 onwards are available here.
