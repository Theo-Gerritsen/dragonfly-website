We created an interface for this dataset of New Zealand sealion tagging records, collected by the Department of Conservation. 

The Department monitors the New Zealand sea lion population, which numbers approximately 10,000 individuals. Tagging and resighting studies of sea lions in the subantarctic are carried out as part of the monitoring programme to better understand sea lion demographics.
