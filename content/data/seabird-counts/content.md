We created an interface for this dataset of the number of seabirds observed around fishing vessels in New Zealand, collected by the Department of Conservation. 

New Zealand is a global centre of seabird diversity, with over 80 species breeding either on the mainland or on offshore islands. New Zealand fisheries observers record the number of seabirds around fishing vessels. These observer data are unique record of the distribution of seabirds in the New Zealand region.
