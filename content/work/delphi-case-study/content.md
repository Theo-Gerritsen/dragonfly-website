We created an online Delphi survey to map the distribution of four species of sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean. The maps fed into simulations of turtle interactions with fisheries produced at a workshop led by the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC).

### Where are the turtles?
Turtles are accidentally caught in the Pacific’s tuna and billfish (swordfish and marlin) fisheries. Understanding how they interact with fisheries is essential for designing methods to reduce this bycatch. Having accurate maps of turtle distribution enabled the workshop to weight the impact of the fisheries appropriately.

### Delphi survey
The Delphi survey method is an alternative to a workshop situation, where participants discuss an issue and agree on a result. Instead, experts contribute their knowledge anonymously via a series of survey questions.

After this first round, a summary of responses is given to the participants, who then repeat the survey. A final result is calculated from these responses, including the spread of responses.

### New maps
The need to update the existing maps of turtle distribution was raised as an issue at the previous WCPFC-led turtle workshop. The workshop had concerns that the maps didn’t reflect the full range of expert opinion, and had also asked for them to be peer-reviewed.

Our Delphi survey was proposed as a solution and we worked closely with the Pacific Community (SPC) to create a bespoke tool to meet their requirements.

### Creating an online survey
Our first Delphi survey was created when we couldn’t find anything suitable online. The survey comprises a series of questions to draw out a participant’s knowledge and in this case, asked experts to colour squares of the Pacific Ocean according to their view on the density of turtles in that area. (We provided relevant published information via links at the bottom of each page, so people could refer to them if they wished.)

Statistical modelling techniques were used to combine the answers and derive a consensus view.

### Delivery
The mapping work was supplied under contract to SPC, which provides science support for the WCPFC. Dr Philip Neubauer travelled to Hawaii to attend the workshop and present an explanation of the mathematics underlying the new maps.

The turtle workshop was supported by the Common Oceans ABNJ Tuna Project and SPC. WCPFC is the international organisation responsible for the management of high seas tuna fisheries and associated species in the western and central Pacific Ocean. It has 26 member countries.

### Application to other sectors
The Delphi method can be a useful planning tool in a range of sectors, such as financial, organisational and risk management. It highlights areas where participants agree or disagree and also shows where information is lacking.


> At our workshops we have people from 20 countries looking at us across the table, so if something doesn’t get done on time or to the required standard, there’s nowhere to hide. The Dragonfly team certainly delivered for us.

> Like many people, I’m a visual thinker and the Delphi graphics really drew the best out of us in terms of response, as opposed to a written survey.

> Everyone was very happy with what they got out of it. By the end of the process, people were comfortable to say that this is the best available information for our purposes – that this is the input we need for the models.
