This project put data on New Zealand’s regional economies online, making the
information widely available. We created a desktop version and iPad and mobile
apps to help people explore the numbers.

### Economic activity by region

The Regional Economic Activity Report presents data on a broad range of
economic activity in New Zealand. As part of the government’s Business Growth Agenda,
Minister Steven Joyce
wanted to make the report accessible to a wider audience by creating an
online version. Regional and city council staff had also requested access to more detailed
information,
to inform their policy and planning around resources, permitting, and business management.

### How we made it happen

We built an interactive desktop version of the report, which was
then released as an iPad and mobile app. A single source of data flows through to the report,
the website, and the apps, to ensure the integrity of the data across all the
presentations. We worked with digital design agency [Salted Herring](http://www.saltedherring.com) to create a look and feel that
matched the Ministry’s own styles. Charts and maps were drawn using the statistical software R, and we used the EmberJS
web framework to create a responsive, dynamic website that could also be cost-effectively delivered as a
mobile app.

### A team effort

To successfully deliver the project, we worked with a large team of up to 30 people across MBIE and
externally. We were able to coordinate this team and deliver the website, following an
extremely tight timetable to meet
the Minister’s release date.
