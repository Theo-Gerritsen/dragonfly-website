We built a prediction service for Immigration New Zealand, to allocate applications
to fast track and review track streams, based on previous decisions. Appropriate handling of applications brings faster and more reliable decision making.

### Demand for visas increasing 
A labour intensive application system at Immigration New Zealand (INZ)
was requiring growing numbers of staff to meet an 
increasing demand for visas. We were contracted to build a front-end triage system to automatically assess each 
visa application upfront. This initial risk assessment grades applications into those that can 
be safely fast tracked and those where a more thorough investigation of the applicant 
is warranted. 


##Ongoing value from data
Since all applications are graded, management can decide where they place the cut-
off between fast track and review track applications. This feature of the system 
allows INZ to choose a level of risk for the visa processing that meets their business
criteria. It also enables workflow and resources to be managed.

Analysis and predictive modelling were carried out by Dragonfly, with technical review from staff at Victoria University. We then ported
the model into the INZ operational environment, running it against a near real-time copy of their database, and delivering predictions 
within 10 minutes of applications being entered into the system. The prediction service makes use of data from past applications, delivering ongoing value to Immigration New Zealand.


> What Dragonfly were able to drag out of our database was pretty impressive â€“ they 
did what we thought couldn't be done. 
>
> This triage system lets us decide our level of risk. We can change the settings to an 
acceptable level, but we still get to choose where we want the trade-off between cost 
and risk to sit. We haven't lost that control.
>
> We worked out the cost saving from this project, in terms of the extra people we 
wouldn't have to hire to cope with the increased visa processing. It was significant.
