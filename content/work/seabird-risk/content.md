  Our assessment of the risk posed to seabird populations from New Zealandâ€™s
  commercial fisheries provided critical information for government policy.

The National Plan of Action&mdash;Seabirds sets out the policy for managing
interactions between fisheries and seabirds. Our seabird risk assessment
underpins that policy - it supports the prioritisation of management actions
and provides clear metrics for assessing the performance of the fishing
industry.

### Risk evaluation leads policy

We carried out a risk assessment for the Ministry for Primary Industries,
using a consistent framework to evaluate the risk to seabird populations from
New Zealand commercial fisheries. More than 70 seabird species breed in the
New Zealand region. By including all these seabirds in the
risk assessment, the Ministry was able to prioritise management actions.
The risk assessment highlights where more information is required to reduce
 uncertainty, and where actions need to be taken to reduce seabird mortalities.

### A Bayesian approach

Information on many seabird species is poor. By using Bayesian statistical
modelling, we were able to work with the available data to produce consistent
results. There are many stakeholders with an interest in seabird
bycatch, including government agencies, the fishing industry and national
and international non-governmental organisations.
A clear, principled approach allowed us to build the trust of the stakeholders.

### Supporting policy and certification

The risk assessment supports government policy in this area, and is in turn used
 to demonstrate their commitment internationally. The assessment
is used by the fishing industry to support the certification of New Zealand
 fisheries as sustainable, increasing the value of those fisheries.
