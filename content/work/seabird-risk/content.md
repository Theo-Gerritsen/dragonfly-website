The National Plan of Action&mdash;Seabirds, is the Ministry for Primary Industries’ key policy for
managing interactions between fisheries and seabirds. The seabird risk assessment underpins that policy, supporting
prioritisation of management actions, and providing clear metrics for assessing the performance of the fishing industry.

### Risk evaluation leads policy
We carried out a risk assessment for the New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries, using a consistent
framework to evaluate the risk to seabird populations from New Zealand commercial fisheries. There are over 70 seabird
species that breed in the New Zealand region. By including all these seabirds in the
risk assessment, the Ministry was able to prioritise management actions. The risk assessment highlights
where more information is required to reduce uncertainty, and where actions need to be taken to reduce seabird mortalities.

### A Bayesian approach
Information on many seabird species is poor. By using Bayesian statistical modelling, we were able to work with 
the available data to produce consistent results. There are many stakeholders with an interest in seabird
bycatch, including government agencies, the fishing industry and national and international Non-Governmental Organisations.
A clear, principled approach allowed us to build the trust of the stakeholders.

### Supporting policy and certification
The risk assessment supports government policy in this area, and is in turn used to demonstrate their commitment internationally. The assessment
is used by the fishing industry to support the certification of New Zealand fisheries as sustainable, increasing the value of those fisheries.
