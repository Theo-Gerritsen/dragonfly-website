We used our expertise in reproducible reporting to improve a team's data
analysis processes. This saved significant time and effort in their regular
report production.

## A complex report

The Regional Economic Activity Report (REAR) presents population,
employment, GDP and annual household income information across New Zealand's
regions and Territorial Authorities. The report is prepared annually by the
Ministry for Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE).
Pulling together this complex document required many resources, and needed
 coordination between analysts, graphics,
and communications teams.

## Mentoring staff in R and LaTeX

We worked with the MBIE sector performance team to help develop the graphics for
this report. Their analysts were using the statistical software R, and we were able to show
the team how to use this powerful software to produce publication quality graphics,
that met the requirements of the graphic designers.

We also introduced the team to software development practices, such as version
control and continuous build processes.

The Ministry requested our support to produce an improved printed version of
the report using LaTeX, a powerful coded typesetting system. Together
LaTeX and R offered significant advantages over traditional
word processing programmes for producing this large report, which has many
figures and tables.

Because LaTeX has a coded interface, helping staff to use and manage the
code themselves was an important part of the project. Ministry staff found our
code and documentation easy to follow and gained
confidence in managing it themselves. With our experience to fall back on,
they enjoyed the fun of working with new processes.

## Beautiful report production

The 2014 REAR’s very polished production has set a new standard for
MBIE’s reporting. LaTeX allows final changes to be made quickly and easily,
which led to the much higher quality output.

Code also equals reproducibility and economy—future reports will be created
by inputting new data rather than creating individual plots from scratch. The
MBIE team believe this feature will save them 70 percent of the preparation
time for future reports.
