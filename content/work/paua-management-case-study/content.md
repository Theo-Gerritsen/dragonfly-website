The New Zealand pāua (abalone) fishery is a $50 million export industry. We 
carry out analysis of pāua fisheries on behalf of the Pāua Industry Council and the Ministry for Primary Industries,
providing the information they need for responsive, well-informed management of 
their sector.

##Information for sustainable fisheries
Good information is essential for the sustainable management of fisheries.
The Pāua Industry Council helps manage catch in New Zealand pāua fisheries, to 
ensure that the populations remain healthy. Pāua divers collect data on each individual dive. From this fishing data,
we are able to map the fishery and monitor its performance, reef by reef.

##Statistical analysis supports decision making
Deciding whether to increase or decrease catches is a tough trade-off for fisheries. Decreasing catches puts 
short-term financial pressure on the fishers, but increasing catches may affect the longer-term sustainability.
We carry out the statistical
analysis needed to interpret the fisheries data, providing the advice the fishers need to balance profitability with the long term health of the population.

### Daily catch data displayed
The statistical analysis is supported by a data management programme. 
We built a web-based system, with each day’s catch data being uploaded
to a database, visualised, and mapped. The data are fed through to a dashboard
system, which allows fishers to make decisions on where to fish to avoid 
depleting the fishery.

The information is of high commercial
value to the fishers, and we have developed processes that maintain the privacy of individual
fisher’s data, while allowing high level summaries to be shared across the industry. The system
is deployed on the [Catalyst Cloud](http://www.catalyst.net.nz/catalyst-cloud), an 
affordable and secure New Zealand cloud computing service.

##Ensuring sustainability 
The Ministry of Primary Industries is very positive about this work. They 
recognise the value that such detailed and timely information provides beyond 
their usual stock assessment process. Robust evidence of 
the state of the fishery will help ensure the sustainability of the fishery.
