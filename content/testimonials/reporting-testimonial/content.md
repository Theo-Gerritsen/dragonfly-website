We are very grateful to Dragonfly. Their work was much more collaborative
than we had experienced with contractors before. For us, the benefits go
way beyond a one-off report.

Yvan was extremely motivated, very easy going and really listened to us â€“
the amount of work he got though was astonishing! Towards the end of the
project, we were working to a very tight timetable to meet the Minister's
deadline for releasing the report, but we all kept our heads and had no issues,
despite being under so much pressure.

If I have another chance to work with Dragonfly I won't hesitate to say yes.
No question.
