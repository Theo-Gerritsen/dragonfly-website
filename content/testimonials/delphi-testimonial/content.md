  Dragonfly’s timeliness of delivery was critical, and one of the reasons
  the project was such a success.
quote_full: >
  At our workshops we have people from 20 countries looking at us across the
  table, so if something doesn’t get done on time or to the required standard,
  there’s nowhere to hide. The Dragonfly team certainly delivered for us.

  Like many people, I’m a visual thinker and the Delphi graphics really drew the
  best out of us in terms of response, as opposed to a written survey.

  Everyone was very happy with what they got out of it. By the end of the
  process, people were comfortable to say that this is the best available
  information for our purposes – that this is the input we need for the models.
