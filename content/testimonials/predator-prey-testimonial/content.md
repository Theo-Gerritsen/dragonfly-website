New laboratory techniques create new data streams, so interpreting that data
is the next challenge. That's a place where Dragonfly really shines. They
understand how to translate ecology into mathematical models, then package
that model so others can use it.

The ability to package a model so it's easily transferable to other
researchers is very new for my lab, and very exciting. Making models into a
public resource really extends the impact and the reach of our research.

Based on past experience, when I'm looking at new projects with a link to
developing new quantitative tools like this, I always think of Dragonfly
because they are such a great organisation to work with. We have a really
valuable collaboration, which I plan to continue.
