  We sat down together and discussed a concept. Then Dragonfly came up with some
  absolutely key ideas that have really made our system what it is.

What we particularly value about Dragonfly is their combination of statistical analysis skills and IT skills. They have a good perspective on why we are doing the IT work.

The tools they build are easy to use and work well. Fisheries scientists have always had to have good IT skills, but it’s fairly unique that they are as polished as Dragonfly’s, in terms of producing IT products and website front ends.

<i>Pisces</i> gives us the opportunity to collaborate on analyses to a far greater extent. We feel it’s a really powerful tool for rapid data analysis. We’re doing simple analyses now that we wouldn’t have bothered with in the past because the process was too time consuming. We’re also doing the complex analyses where we rely on Pisces to ensure reproducibility.”
