What Dragonfly were able to drag out of our database was pretty impressive â€“ they
did what we thought couldn't be done.

This triage system lets us decide our level of risk. We can change the settings to an
acceptable level, but we still get to choose where we want the trade-off between cost
and risk to sit. We haven't lost that control.

We worked out the cost saving from this project, in terms of the extra people we
wouldn't have to hire to cope with the increased visa processing. It was significant.
