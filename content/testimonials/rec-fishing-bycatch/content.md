Working closely with Dragonfly meant that we were all very clear about what we
needed the system to do. They put it together in a way that met the brief but
with an intuitive look and feel that was a value-add to the process.

Iggy was brilliant as a project manager and clearly defined what was required at
each stage of the process. He had to work closely with the developer from Xequals
to amalgamate two separate systems to collect and display data. The way he
approached the work and managed the relationship between the three parties was
key to creating a tool that met our needs.

Support is always there. If I need to follow up about something or have a
question, Iggy and the team are always just an email away.
