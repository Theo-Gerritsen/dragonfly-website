  It was very smooth sailing, and what we expected was what we got.

  Our project involved understanding the RMA, which is a hefty and dynamic piece
  of legislation. Dragonfly's interest in and ability to come to grips with the
  act and how it is applied was really key to the success of the project.

  How Dragonfly set up the framework so we could populate it sensibly were some
  of the most elegant parts of the code base. I really valued Dragonfly's
  exquisite communication skills – they are also excellent listeners. I found
  them to be passionate, talented and good company.

  Dragonfly were flexible and adaptable
  despite changes in scope as the nature of the business problem evolved. They
  were unflappable.
