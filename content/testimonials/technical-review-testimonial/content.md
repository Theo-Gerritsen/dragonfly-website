The modelling techniques that UniQuest applied to our complex data are cutting edge and evolving all the time. I was aware that Dragonfly have also been involved in creating those techniques, so were very well placed to assess how well they had been employed for us.

I’m not an expert in modelling so I appreciated that the review was professional, concise, and not filled with technical jargon. Because it was a logical and impartial critique of my client’s work, I sent it directly to them, which saved me a lot of time. My client found the review useful and agreed with everything that Dragonfly said needed to be done.

The review was provided on time and in budget – that's important to us in government with tight budgets and accountability for them.
