I can’t think of a more difficult species to model than albatross. They breed
every second year, the chick goes to sea for 3–8 years, they start breeding at
different ages and their probability of survival increases as they get older.
It’s very complex to put that together, but this model fuses all the data in a
really neat way.

There have been previous modelling attempts but this is a step up for sure.
Models are never perfect, but we’re very happy with this work – that's why it
got put on the Minister’s desk.
