When there’s a contentious issue of high public interest, it’s very important
for people to know for themselves what going on, rather than relying on rumour
or hearsay.

With complex issues, people have a whole range of questions that you can’t
readily answer in one report or analysis. An online presentation of those data
allows people to find the information they need to answer their own questions.

Making the information on protected species captures readily accessible was
particularly important because of the high public interest in the issue. This
also reduced the number of queries for the data that were being made to us and
the Ministry for Primary Industries.
