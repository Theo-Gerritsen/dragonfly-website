I was impressed by Dragonfly’s ability to bring a quantitative approach to this real world issue.

Research relating to fisheries management typically doesn’t produce tidy datasets, but Dragonfly routinely works through such difficulties with aplomb.

From the design phase to the final analysis, they linked results back to objectives and consistently produced strong, defensible outputs and delivered value for money. I also appreciated the sense of a research partnership that working with them engendered.
