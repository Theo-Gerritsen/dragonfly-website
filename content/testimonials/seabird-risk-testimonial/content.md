In assessing the risk of commercial fisheries to New Zealand’s seabird populations,
Dragonfly bridged the gap between science and its associated uncertainties, and policy
and its inherent conflicts. They fostered an open and inclusive approach with all stakeholders.

The assessment exercise has given us a new perspective on the risks posed by commercial fisheries, and in particular highlighted risks facing seabirds in New Zealand’s inshore fisheries.
