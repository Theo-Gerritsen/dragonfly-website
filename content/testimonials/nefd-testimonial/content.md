  It was very smooth sailing, and what we expected was what we got.

  I'd call and they'd respond. We were always able to contact Dragonfly and have
  a chat about what was going on. I really appreciated that. I've managed a lot
  of contracts and I haven't had that before.

  This project was a good place to start and enabled us to get a win on the
  table. It has potentially future proofed the report production down the track,
  which will save even more time in the following years. It's also reduced our
  dependence on having senior staff available for the data analysis.

  Dragonfly staff were constantly communicating what was needed and whose
  responsibility it was to do what. I'm notoriously hard to pin down, so they
  worked with the people I delegated to make the decisions that were needed.
  We got the report published on time – and it was great!
