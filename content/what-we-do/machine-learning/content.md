Machine learning tends to outperform traditional handcrafted analysis systems because unlike humans, it doesn’t make any assumptions about the data. It can take raw text or data from sensors (like cameras and microphones) and classify and organise it to provide the information needed for decision-making.

We are currently using machine learning with really diverse datasets, which are big and messy. Our customised models and methods are helping clients find themes in large amounts of text, analyse forest satellite data and work on speech recognition.

While more data means we can use bigger models and get better results, large models quickly become an engineering problem. There’s a challenge for us here to write code that interacts with the specialised hardware very efficiently.
