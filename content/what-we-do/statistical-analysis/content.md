We use models to make sense of a part of the world when we don’t know everything about it. If we know a particular variable exists but not its exact value, we can use statistical analysis to incorporate a range of possible values into a model.

Our clients often use models to predict what could happen in the future if some of the values changed. Models can show how different management alters the status of a resource – including making the resource more sustainable. Decision-making is more robust if you can predict what’s likely to happen in the next 5 years based on what you’re doing now.

While we often use simple methods and open source software at Dragonfly, we put them together in ways that are very well thought through. With really good systems, there’s no need to start from scratch every time. Instead, we can use new information and innovate to build a model that’s even closer to reality.
