  Everybody’s data has value, and it needs to be kept safe, accessible and
  possibly open. We build well-managed systems that meet all these requirements.

  Having data stored in the correct way is foundational. Databases open up a
  whole bunch of possibilities for automation and reproducibility. This is the
  kind of work where Dragonfly really excels.

  Why we believe information should be stored, categorised, organised and
  indexed correctly.

The Dragonfly model is go from the data to the end result, building a pipeline
to get there. We talk to clients about what they want and always treat their
data with respect.

Information inevitably gets lost if you’re not keeping track of everything and
storing it in the right way. That can be costly in both money and time. But if
we help to categorise, organise and index the information, everything that goes
in and everything that comes out looks a certain way, and is reliable. After
that we can iterate and improve on it.

We don’t like to do things manually or in a tedious fashion. Let the computer
do the things it’s good at! Automation is about not doing the same thing twice
if you don’t have to – but doing it right the first time. We can lead more
productive lives by automating the work that nobody wants to do.
