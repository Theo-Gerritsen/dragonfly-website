We show that there are three cases for which the generic intersections of *p*-dimensional extended object solutions of a supersymmetric field theory in a *d*-dimensional space-time are stringlike. They are (i)*d* = 4, *p* = 2, (ii) *d* = 6, p = 3 and (iii) *d* = 10, *p* = 5. By consideration of the topological charges associated with these objects we obtain a necessary condition for stable stringlike intersections to occur, a condition that is satisfied by the first two cases but *not* the third, which may have implications for the “heterotic 5-branes” recently discussed by Strominger. For case (i) we show by an analysis of the *d* = 4 Wess-Zumino model that stringlike intersections of domain walls can indeed occur.
