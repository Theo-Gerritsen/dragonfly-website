Seabird bycatch has been reported from surface-longline fisheries for more
than two decades. Characteristics of surface-longline gear that exacerbate
the likelihood of seabird captures include its light weight, the long length
of lines and snoods to which hooks are attached, and the attractiveness
of baits to seabirds. Despite a well-researched suite of measures that
have been shown to be effective in reducing seabird bycatch on this
fishing gear, ongoing bycatch occurs in New Zealand and internationally.
This continuing bycatch may be due to the inconsistent or insufficient
implementation of existing measures, or the incompatibility of existing
measures with gear types or fishing operations. In particular, safety issues
associated with line-weighting -- one effective method proven to reduce
seabird bycatch risk -- appears to have reduced uptake of this measure in
New Zealand.

Globally, there is ongoing research into new measures to reduce seabird
bycatch in surface-longline fisheries. Improved safety is a key component of
the development of some of these measures. In this project, we trialled four
devices intended to reduce the risk of seabird bycatch in surface-longline
fisheries. These devices were (i) safe leads, weighing 60 g and comprising
two lead pellets secured with O-rings around a rubber core, through which
the monofilament snood passes, (ii) luminous plastic-covered "lumo" leads,
weighing 40 g (iii) lumo leads weighing 60 g, respectively comprising a
partly or fully lead-filled tapered plastic cylinder which attaches to longline
snoods via a screw cap, and (iv) hook pods, which completely enclose
longline hooks during setting until the fishing depth is reached. Safe
leads and lumo leads are designed to move on snoods when monofilament
stretches, and tension is suddenly released. This situation can arise during
longline hauling, and the movement of the weights is designed to reduce
the potentially dangerous recoil resulting in a weight flying back towards
the vessel. Hook pods also move on the snood, though less readily than the
other weight types.

In 2013, we trialled safe leads and 60-g lumo leads on one vessel each.
In 2014, we tested 40-g lumo leads and hook pods on a third vessel. All
vessels operated in New Zealand's surface-longline fishery, and targeted
tunas and swordfish. The deployments of safe leads and 60-g lumo leads
were overseen by government fisheries observers. A dedicated technician
implemented the 40-g lumo lead and hook pod trials. Trials of safe leads
and lumo leads followed a broadly balanced design with half the snoods
on longlines being weighted with the devices being tested, and the other
half comprising "normal" fishing gear, configured and deployed as per
the skipper's typical operations. Across the experimental and normal
snoods, weighted swivels and lightsticks were deployed in accordance with
the skipper's preference. Time-depth recorders (TDRs) were deployed on
snoods to measure sink rate, generally at three approximately equally-spaced
locations in a longline basket.

For hook pods, the smaller number of pods available led to an approach of
deploying approximately 50 pods on a longline. TDRs were also deployed on hook pods (and snoods in these sets not carrying pods) to document sink rates.

For all devices tested, snood characteristics (e.g., lightstick attachment)
and fish catch were documented at hauling, and TDRs were retrieved for
downloading. The location of experimental weights on snoods was also
documented. Finally, the operational characteristics of the experimental
weights were documented, including feedback from skippers and crew.
For the trips during which 40-g lumo leads were deployed, fish catch was
compared using permutation testing. The effects of weighted swivels at the
clip and lightsticks were also explored using a model-based approach.
Over seven trips on the three vessels, weighting methods were examined on
6–21 sets. Sets comprised 600–1400 hooks. Across the weighting methods
trialled, 41–130 TDR records were retrieved. Although not the focus of the
project, captures of three albatross (*Thalassarche* spp.) and two New Zealand
fur seal (*Arctocephalus forsteri*) were recorded.

There was considerable variation in longline sink rates amongst the
experimental weighting approaches tested and the sets using skippers'
normal gear setups. To depths of 7 m, safe leads sank slightly faster, on
average, than normal gear. Beyond 7 m, average sink rates of gear carrying
safe leads and normal gear were extremely similar. Below 2 m depth, gear
carrying 60-g lumo leads sank faster, on average, than normal gear. Average
sink rates of 40-g lumo leads were faster than normal gear. On average,
snoods carrying hook pods sank more rapidly than normal gear, to a depth
of around 6 m. Beyond that depth, normal gear sank more rapidly. In
addition to the weights themselves, factors affecting gear sink rate included
the presence of lightsticks on snoods and the deployment method used to
set snoods.

Fish catch was dominated by tunas, swordfish (*Xiphias gladius*) and blue
shark (*Prionace glauca*). For tunas and swordfish, catch rates on snoods
carrying 40-g lumo leads did not differ from catch on normal snoods.
However, the catch rate of sharks on snoods carrying lumo leads was
significantly lower than for normal gear. Shark catch was also reduced on
snoods with weighted swivels at the clip, whereas snoods with weighted
swivels and lightsticks showed reduced tuna catch.

The crews of all vessels readily adapted to the addition of the experimental
weights to the fishing gear. One incidence of potentially dangerous recoil
involved a safe lead, and there were 12 incidents involving the recoil of
lumo leads. However, cases where the experimental weights had slid under
tension were also recorded. Recommendations for improving the design of
lumo leads and hook pods include refining the shape of the devices and how
they attach to the monofilament snoods. While the experimental weights
tested were designed to reduce safety risks associated with weighting
surface longline snoods, they do not eliminate them. Caution and vigilance
is still required to minimise ongoing safety risks, especially when hauling
longline gear.
