Life for many of the world's marine fish begins at the ocean surface.
Ocean conditions dictate food availability and govern survivorship,
yet little is known about the habitat preferences of larval
fish during this highly vulnerable life-history stage. Here we show
that surface slicks, a ubiquitous coastal ocean convergence feature,
are important nurseries for larval fish from many ocean habitats
at ecosystem scales. Slicks had higher densities of marine
phytoplankton (1.7-fold), zooplankton (larval fish prey; 3.7-fold),
and larval fish (8.1-fold) than nearby ambient waters across our
study region in Hawai'i. Slicks contained larger, more well-developed
individuals with competent swimming abilities compared
to ambient waters, suggesting a physiological benefit to increased
prey resources. Slicks also disproportionately accumulated prey-size
plastics, resulting in a 60-fold higher ratio of plastics to larval fish
prey than nearby waters. Dissections of hundreds of larval fish found
that 8.6% of individuals in slicks had ingested plastics, a 2.3-fold
higher occurrence than larval fish from ambient waters. Plastics were
found in 7 of 8 families dissected, including swordfish (Xiphiidae), a
commercially targeted species, and flying fish (Exocoetidae), a principal
prey item for tuna and seabirds. Scaling up across an âˆ¼1,000 km2
coastal ecosystem in Hawai'i revealed slicks occupied only 8.3% of
ocean surface habitat but contained 42.3% of all neustonic larval fish
and 91.8% of all floating plastics. The ingestion of plastics by larval
fish could reduce survivorship, compounding threats to fisheries productivity
posed by overfishing, climate change, and habitat loss.
