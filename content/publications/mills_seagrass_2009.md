title: Seagrass (<i>Zostera muelleri</i>) patch size and spatial location influence infaunal macroinvertebrate assemblages
---
Seagrass landscapes are coastal environments that support diverse and abundant faunal communities. This study investigated infaunal assemblage patterns in fragmented and continuous *Zostera muelleri* habitat in southeastern New Zealand. Intertidal macroinvertebrate assemblages were examined in fragmented seagrass habitat (containing discrete patches varying in size from 1 to 200 m<sup>2</sup>) and continuous meadows (>1000 m<sup>2</sup>), in a small and a large tidal inlet. Community indices differed between seagrass habitat types and the total number of taxa was significantly lower at fragmented seagrass sites in one of the inlets. The total number of individuals and diversity were significantly different between fragmented and continuous seagrass habitat in both inlets, but diversity values showed inconsistent patterns between inlets. Multivariate analysis confirmed that different seagrass habitat types support distinct macrofaunal assemblages in each inlet and position on the shore was identified as the single most important variable explaining dissimilarities in assemblage compositions. These findings confirm the influence of seagrass habitat size on infaunal assemblages and also highlight the importance of spatial position of seagrass habitat in intertidal areas.
