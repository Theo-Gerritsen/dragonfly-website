Fisheries management is most effective when based on scientific estimates of sustainable
fishing rates. While some simple approaches allow estimation of harvest limits, more data-intensive
stock assessments are generally required to evaluate the stock's biomass and
fishing rates relative to sustainable levels. Here we evaluate how stock characteristics relate
to the rate of new assessments in the United States. Using a statistical model based on
time-to-event analysis and 569 coastal marine fish and invertebrate stocks landed in commercial
fisheries, we quantify the impact of region, habitat, life-history, and economic factors
on the annual probability of being assessed. Although the majority of landings come from
assessed stocks in all regions, less than half of the regionally-landed species currently have
been assessed. As expected, our time-to-event model identified landed tonnage and exvessel
price as the dominant factors determining increased rates of new assessments. However,
we also found that after controlling for landings and price, there has been a consistent
bias towards assessing larger-bodied species. A number of vulnerable groups such as rockfishes
(Scorpaeniformes) and groundsharks (Carcharhiniformes) have a relatively high
annual probability of being assessed after controlling for their relatively small tonnage and
low price. Due to relatively low landed tonnage and price of species that are currently unassessed,
our model suggests that the number of assessed stocks will increase more slowly
in future decades
