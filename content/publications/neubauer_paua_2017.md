title: The pﾄ「a data-logger system
---
The pﾄ「a data-logger system was conceived to provide high-resolution information
on spatial resource use and catch-per-unit-effort in the pﾄ「a fisheries around
New Zealand. The system consists of two hard- ware components, the boat unit and
the turtle loggers, which together record catch (boat unit) and effort (recorded
by the turtle logger, worn by free-diving fishers), and a database system. The
database system manages uploads from the units and processes the data into a set
of tables for analysis and visualisation.  A web-based frontend tool allows
users and administrators to assess the data quality and correct errors.  Since
its inception, the system has provided valuable information about pﾄ「a fishing
activity, especially spatial trends in some of the quota management areas. This
report presents a stocktake of the current state of the programme, discusses
areas for improvement, and makes recommendations for the programme to transition
successfully to the new Integrated Electronic Monitoring and Reporting System,
mandated by the Ministry for Primary Industries from 1 October 2017.
