The	Final	Global	Seabird	Bycatch	Assessment	Workshop	was	held	from	25	February	to	1	March	2019.
Participants	at	the	workshop	are	listed	in	Annex	1;	the	workshop	agenda	is	shown	in	Annex	2.	The
workshop	comprised	presentations,	data	analysis	and	discussion.	Workshop	participants	agreed	to	a
report	format	that	was	focused	on	Background/Methods/Results/Discussion,	in	order	to	present	the
results	of	the	analyses	in	the	clearest	way.		

The	report adoption	procedure	was	discussed	and	explained	to	participants. The	report	adopted	at
the	workshop,	with	track	changes	and	agreed	additional	amendments annoted	as	‘comments’,	was
circulated	 to	 all	 participants as	 the	 meeting	 closed.	 The	 project	 team	 them	 completed	 the
amendments	as	agreed	by	participants,	and	the	technical	annexes	were	added.	This	cleaned	version
was	 then	 circulated	 to	 all	 participants	 and	 then	 shared with	 FAO,	 and	 finalised.	 No	 further
diagnostics	can	be	undertaken	as	the	dataset	no	longer	exists.
