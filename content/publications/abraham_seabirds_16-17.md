A wide range of seabird species are caught in New Zealand commercial fisheries.  
Managing the impacts of fisheries on seabird populations requires understanding
what species are being caught and in which fisheries the captures are occurring.  
When government fisheries observers are onboard commercial fishing vessels, they
record the seabird captures that occur, and these records may be used to estimate
 total seabird captures.

This study presents the most recent annual assessment of seabird captures,
including the 2016–17 fishing year.  The assessment used statistical
 models to obtain estimates of total seabird captures across all
commercial trawl and longline fisheries.  The time periods covered in this
estimation were the 2002–03 to 2016–17 fishing years for
trawl fisheries, and the 1998–99 to 2016–17 fishing years
for longline fisheries.

The present assessment used a unified modelling framework to estimate incidental
captures of seabirds for ten species and species groups: New Zealand white-capped
albatross (*Thalassarche steadi*), Salvin’s albatross (*Thalassarche salvini*),
Buller's albatrosses (*Thalassarche bulleri*, combining both southern *T. b. bulleri*
and northern *T. b. platei* subspecies), white-chinned petrel
(*Procellaria aequinoctialis*), black petrel (*Procellaria parkinsoni*), grey
petrel (*Procellaria cinerea*), sooty shearwater (*Puffinus griseus*), and
flesh-footed shearwater (*Puffinus carneipes*). Estimates were also derived for
seabirds grouped as either "other albatrosses" or "other birds".  

There were a total of 4210 (95% c.i.: 3508–5296) estimated seabird captures in
trawl and longline fisheries (c.i., credible interval, the 95th quantile range
of the posterior distribution) in 2016–17.  The total estimate included 1767
(95% c.i.: 1493–2145) seabird captures in trawl fisheries, 1869 (95% c.i.:
1286–2909) captures in bottom-longline fisheries, and 573 (95% c.i.: 426–789)
captures in surface-longline fisheries.

White-chinned petrel had the highest number of total estimated captures in
2016–17, with 995 (95% c.i.: 557–1882) captures of this species.  The second
highest estimate was 448 (95% c.i.: 349–574) captures of New Zealand white-capped
albatross, followed by 435 (95% c.i.: 293–670) captures of flesh-footed shearwater.  
Capture estimates for other species included 451 (95% c.i.: 272–810) captures of
Salvin's albatross, 286 (95% c.i.: 189–442) captures of black petrel, 226
(95% c.i.: 157–326) captures of Buller's albatrosses, 398 (95% c.i.: 276–615)
captures of sooty shearwater and 176 (95% c.i.: 67–465) captures of grey petrel.
 In addition to estimates for individual species, there were 563 (95% c.i.: 376–859)
 captures of other birds and 228 (95% c.i.: 148–362) captures of other albatrosses.

Considering capture estimates over time, there was a decrease in the total number
of estimated captures for seven of the ten modelled species groups between 2002–03
 and 2016–17. This decrease largely corresponded with decreases in fishing effort
 over this period.  For three species, Salvin's albatross, white-chinned petrel
 and grey petrel, there was no distinct decrease in total captures over the
assessment period; only white-chinned petrel had higher mean estimated captures
in 2016–17 than in 2002–03.

Among different fisheries, large-vessel fisheries had sufficient number of
captures to examine temporal trends. In large-vessel squid trawl fisheries, there
was an initial decrease in albatross captures after the introduction of mandatory
warp mitigation in January 2006, but capture rates of albatrosses have not clearly
decreased since the 2006–07 fishing year.  Capture rates of petrels in large-vessel
squid trawl fisheries showed a distinct pattern of higher captures in alternate years.  
The reasons for this distinct fluctuation are unknown.

When the model was updated, captures were estimated for all previous years. Comparison
of estimates between the current and previous models for the 2015–16 fishing year
showed some changes, including a decrease in the mean estimated captures of black
petrel in small-vessel longline fisheries. Overall, however, there was
agreement between the estimates from the two models.

The estimation of seabird bycatch relies on observer data.  Between 2002–03 and 2016–17,
around 50%, 60%, and 40% of small bottom-longline, surface-longline and trawl vessels,
respectively, had no observers placed on them for any fishing during the 14 years.
The observer coverage across these fisheries was
also low (at around 2%, 6% and 2%, respectively). With a core of vessels that had
no observer coverage, and with low observer coverage overall, bycatch in the
small-vessel fleet may not be adequately represented in the
observer data.  Increasing observer coverage in small-vessel fisheries, and
ensuring that observers are placed across the fleet so that all vessels have at
least some observer coverage, would help to ensure that estimates
based on observer data reliably reflect protected species bycatch across New
Zealand's trawl and longline fisheries.
