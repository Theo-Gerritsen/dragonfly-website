The pāua *Haliotis iris* dive-logger data collection programme is an industry-led initiative aimed at achieving
near real-time monitoring of the fishery. The dive loggers record the position, depth, and duration of
individual dives, and allow the individual catch to be recorded. This detailed data recording is expected
to allow the management of the fishery to be at finer spatial and temporal scales than is currently possible.

Here, we provide a first description of the dive-logger programme. We assessed the current coverage of
the fishery by the logger programme by comparing dive-logger data with data reported on Pāua Catch
Effort and Landing Return (PCELR) forms. To determine whether the dive-logger programme is relevant
for fisheries management, we used Bayesian linear mixed models to gain an understanding of the relationship
between logger-derived effort and catch data, both at large scales (using daily records from all
Quota Management Areas (QMAs) and years) and small scales (catches and individual dives aggregated
to 1-hectare (ha; 10 000 m<sup>2</sup>) hexagons).

We found that an increasing number of divers participated in the data-logger programme in the period
from the 2010–11 to the 2013–14 fishing year. The catch recorded on data loggers also covered an
increasing percentage of the total catch of the pāua fishery, including more than 50% of the total catch
in QMAs PAU 7 and PAU 3 in 2012–13 and 2013–14. Some limitations remain, both with reporting
(erroneous diver identifiers or catch reported) and with the logger hardware (e.g., missing locations);
however, the quality of the data are improving as the coverage increases.

The data provided insights into dive patterns within QMAs, which, although variable, showed some
consistent trends towards longer and shallower dives. Models at both large and small scales suggested
that dive variables, especially bottom time (the time spent diving relative to the total fishing time), were
strongly related to catch. At equivalent total effort (total fishing time), increased bottom times thus
predicted increased catches. From the modelling, we recommend bottom time (relative to total fishing
time) as a useful indicator of fishery status.

Spatial patterns in the fishery were also investigated using areas and effort concentration measures calculated
from kernel utilisation densities (KUDs). On large scales, patchy diving within the total area
searched over the day was correlated with lower catches, whereas on the hexagon scale, patchy diving
was correlated with higher catches, possibly due to diving on pāua aggregations. We suggest that daily
area and concentration indices could serve as indicators of trends in the fishery if monitored over time.

Overall, the logger data provide considerable information about the fishery, and are likely to provide
fishery-relevant data that can be used to gain an understanding of patterns and trends in the fishery. As
both the quality of the data and the volume of data increase, the proposed metrics will become more
useful, and more complex metrics such as spatial catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) can be constructed to
identify local depletion. To illustrate this potential, we estimated a CPUE index at both statistical-area
and 1-ha hexagon scales. This estimation showed up to fourfold differences in CPUE among statistical
areas within QMAs.
