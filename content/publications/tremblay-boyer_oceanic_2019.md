The present study evaluates potential alternative assessment methods for
sharks, using oceanic whitetip shark (*Carcharhinus longimanus*) as a case study,
allowing comparisons with the current age-structured integrated stock assessment
 of  this species. The latter was conducted in parallel to the present study,
 and used Stock Synthesis 3 (SS3) software.
