This is the second stock assessment for oceanic whitetip shark in the WCPO
following that of Rice & Harley (2012), and the first since CMM2011-04
became active in 2013, enacting a no-retention measure for this species for
WCPFC Members, Cooperating Non-Members and Participating Territories (CCMs).
This assessment for oceanic whitetip shark was performed in the Stock
Synthesis modelling framework (Methot Jr & Wetzel 2013), an integrated
 age-structured population model previously used to assess the status of sharks
  in the Pacific Ocean and elsewhere. The population dynamics model was informed
 by three sources of data: historical catches, time series of
 catch-per-unit-effort and length frequencies. We maintained the four-fleet
structure used in the previous stock assessment, splitting the longline fishery
into bycatch and target fleets, and the purse-seine fishery into
fleets of associated and unassociated sets.

A new development in this assessment was the inclusion of discard mortality (DM)
 scenarios in the historical catches. This was a key step to account for the
 potential impacts of the no-retention measure for oceanic whitetip sharks.Three
  scenarios were used assuming 25%, 43.75% and 100% mortality on the discards,
  accounting for mortality at different stages of the discarding process from
  the catch event and crew handling to post-release mortality. In addition,
  results from two new WCPO growth studies predicted a much less productive
profile for the stock than what had been assumed previously. Because growth was
a key uncertainty in this assessment, we use two growth and fecundity assessment
'profiles' to reflect the differences between growth studies, and
ensure that conclusions about stock status were robust to the uncertainty about
life-history parameters.

We developed a diagnostic case for the assessment based on the model with the
best overall diagnostics, an informative likelihood profile, and the most
reasonable assumptions about biology and fleet settings based on current
knowledge about oceanic whitetip shark and the fisheries that catch this
species. Based on the results from the one-off sensitivities
from the diagnostic case and previous discussions at the Pre-Assessment
workshop (Pilling & Brouwer 2019), a set of uncertainty axes for the model was
defined outlining alternative values for key uncertainties and
influential model or biological parameters. The combination of all levels across
 axes forms the structural uncertainty grid with a total of 648 individual model
  runs.

Stock status was obtained by summarizing reference points over all grid runs to
account for the assumptions about life-history parameters and impact of fishing
underpinning the assessment. We estimate the stock to be overfished and
undergoing overfishing based on *SB/SB<sub>MSY</sub>* and *F/F<sub>MSY</sub>*
reference points and assuming equal weightings for grid levels. This overall
conclusion is the same as that from the previous assessment, despite a wider
range of uncertainties being considered, notably in the growth and fecundity
parameters. In terms of the depletion of the spawning biomass, most model runs
predict *SB/SB<sub>0</sub>* to be below 0.05, and all model runs predict
*SB/SB<sub>0</sub>* to be below 0.1. Given the high levels of depletion,
we focus on *SB/SB<sub>0</sub>* as a biomass-based reference point throughout.

We found that *F*-based reference points improved in the period since CMM2011-04
 became active, which covers the last 4 years of the assessment's time-span
 (2013–2016). Notably, *F/F<sub>MSY</sub>* is predicted to have declined
by more than half from 6.12 to 2.67 (median) for the last year of the assessment
 when the impact of CMM2011-04 on survival is accounted for under the 25% and
 43.75% discard mortality scenarios. *F* levels relative to two alternative
 reference points, *F/F<sub>lim,AS</sub>* and *F/F<sub>crash,AS</sub>*, follow
 similar trends following the adoption of the measure.

All catch scenarios accounting for DM <100% showed a very slight increase in
spawning biomass since 2013, but final levels of depletion (*SB/SB<sub>0</sub>*)
 remain very low over all grid runs (median: 0.0367, 95%CI: 0.021–0.061). Given
 the assessment assumes oceanic whitetip sharks to become mature after 4 or 8 years,
stock recovery should be expected to be slow in the period following the
conservation measure while the spawning biomass rebuilds. Despite
the relative improvements in F-based reference points since 2013, the median
value of *F/F<sub>crash</sub>* over all 648 grid runs
for 2016 remains above 1 (median: 1.41, 95%CI: 0.98–2.15), indicating that the
population should go extinct on the long-term under current levels of fishing mortality.
