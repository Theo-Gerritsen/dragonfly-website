title:  Individual based, spatially explicit models to explore the mating systems of the red rock lobster <i>Jasus edwardsii</i> and the Caribbean spiny lobster <i>Panulirus argus</i>
---
Field and laboratory experiments have been undertaken over the last decade
investigating various aspects of the mating system of the red or southern rock
lobster *Jasus edwardsii* (Fig. 1) and the Caribbean spiny lobster  *Panulirus
argus* (briefly  reported in earlier editions of the Lobster  Newsletter: Vol.
8 No. 2, December 1995; Vol 12, No. 1, June 1999; Vol. 18 No. 1, February
2005). We have now constructed separate, but similar models describing the
mating systems of these two species.
