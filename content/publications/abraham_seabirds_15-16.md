Interactions with commercial fisheries can lead to the incidental capture of
non-target species, such as seabirds and marine mammals.  In New Zealand waters,
captures of seabirds and other protected species are recorded by government
observers when they are on-board commercial fishing vessels. These data are used
in bycatch assessments to estimate the number of seabirds that would be reported
caught  if every commercial vessel fishing within New Zealand's Exclusive
Economic Zone carried an observer.

This study presents the most recent bycatch assessment, including the
2015–16 fishing year.  The assessment was based on statistical
models that were used to obtain estimates of total seabird captures across all
commercial trawl and longline fisheries.  The time periods covered in this
estimation were the 2002–03 to 2015–16 fishing years for
trawl fisheries, and the  1998–99 to 2015–16 fishing years
for longline fisheries.

The present assessment used a unified modelling framework to estimate incidental
captures of seabirds for ten species and species groups: New Zealand white-capped albatross (*Thalassarche steadi*), Salvin’s albatross (*Thalassarche salvini*), Buller's albatrosses (*Thalassarche bulleri*, combining both southern *T. b. bulleri* and northern *T. b. platei* subspecies), white-chinned petrel (*Procellaria aequinoctialis*), black petrel (*Procellaria parkinsoni*), grey petrel (*Procellaria cinerea*), sooty shearwater (*Puffinus griseus*), and flesh-footed shearwater (*Puffinus carneipes*).  Estimates were also derived for
seabirds grouped as either "other albatrosses" or "other birds".  

The estimation revealed a total of 4517 (95% c.i.: 3760–5825) seabird
captures in trawl and longline fisheries (c.i., credible interval, the 95th
quantile range of the posterior distribution) in 2015–16.  The
total estimate included 1695 (95% c.i.: 1462–1998) seabird captures in
trawl fisheries, 1982 (95% c.i.: 1343–3196) captures in bottom-longline
fisheries, and 839 (95% c.i.: 632–1157) captures in surface-longline
fisheries.  

For individual seabird species included in the modelling, white-chinned petrel
had the highest number of total estimated captures in 2015–16,
with 1041 (95% c.i.: 577–2156) captures of this species.  The
second highest estimate was 496 (95% c.i.: 393–633)
captures of New Zealand white-capped albatross, followed by
469 (95% c.i.: 299–751) captures of flesh-footed
shearwater.  Capture estimates for other species included
435 (95% c.i.: 291–679) captures of Salvin's
albatross, 360 (95% c.i.: 194–733) captures of black petrel,  
358 (95% c.i.: 274–480) captures of Buller's
albatrosses, 266 (95% c.i.: 169–450) captures
of sooty shearwater and 197 (95% c.i.: 72–517) captures
of grey petrel.  In addition to estimates for individual species,
capture estimates for species groupings were 585 (95% c.i.: 404–866)
captures of other birds and 306 (95% c.i.: 195–500) captures
of other albatrosses.

There was a decrease in the total number of estimated
captures for seven of the ten modelled species groups between
2002–03 and 2015–16. For three species,
Salvin's albatross, white-chinned petrel and grey petrel, there was no distinct
decrease in total captures over the assessment period; only  
white-chinned petrel had higher mean estimated captures in 2015–16 than in 2002–03.
Across all trawl and longline fisheries, the mean number of seabird captures was
 lower in 2015–16 than in any year in the series.
This decrease largely corresponded with decreases in fishing effort over the reporting period.

Large-vessel fisheries had sufficient captures to allow time-trends in capture
rates to be estimated. In large-vessel squid trawl fisheries, there was an
initial decrease in albatross captures after the introduction of mandatory warp
mitigation before the 2006–07 fishing year, but capture rates showed an
increase between 2013–14 and 2015–16.  Capture rates of petrels
in  large-vessel squid trawl fisheries showed a distinct pattern of higher
captures in alternate years.  The reasons for this distinct fluctuation are
unknown.

This analysis depends on observer coverage. Observer coverage remains low in
small-vessel inshore fisheries where many seabird captures are estimated to
occur. Increasing observer coverage in small-vessel fisheries would reduce uncertainty
in bycatch estimates.
