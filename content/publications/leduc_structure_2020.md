Submarine canyons can facilitate the transfer of land‐derived organic matter to the deep sea.
Here, we investigated links between variability in organic matter availability from land
and marine sources and infauna communities in two contrasting canyon systems off New
Zealand and used stable isotope analyses to identify potential food sources of benthic
invertebrates. Kaikōura Canyon, a steep, short canyon close to the shore, was characterized
by high food availability and varying proportions of marine‐ and land‐derived organic matter,
whereas Hokitika Canyon, a narrow and lower‐gradient canyon that extends further from the coast,
was characterized by low food availability and mostly land‐derived sediment organic matter throughout.
Both macrofaunal and meiofaunal abundance and biomass were greater in Kaikōura Canyon than in Hokitika
Canyon. Correlation analyses suggested that land‐derived organic matter may contribute to increased
meiofaunal abundance in Kaikōura Canyon. Carbon and nitrogen isotopic analyses, however, did not
provide unequivocal support for the uptake of land‐derived material by large benthic invertebrates
in Kaikōura Canyon. Infaunal abundance and biomass were low throughout Hokitika Canyon despite similar
concentrations of land‐derived organic matter in sediments of both canyons, which suggests that variations
in marine‐derived organic matter inputs is the main driver of community differences among canyons.
Refractory vascular plant material by itself may not provide an adequate food supply to infaunal
organisms, but may represent a complementary food resource when more labile marine phytodetritus
is also readily available.
