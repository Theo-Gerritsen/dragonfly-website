The present study evaluates potential alternative assessment methods for
sharks, using oceanic whitetip shark (*Carcharhinus longimanus*) as a case study,
allowing comparisons with the current age-structured integrated stock assessment
 of  this species. The latter was conducted in parallel to the present study,
 and used Stock Synthesis 3 (SS3) software.

The most recent previous integrated assessment of oceanic whitetip shark
concluded that the stock was overfished and that overfishing was continuing.
To minimise ongoing fisheries impacts on this species, a non-retention measure
 (Conservation and Management Measure CMM 2011-04) was imposed by the Western
 and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC); however, the non-retention of
 oceanic whitetip shark also introduced additional uncertainty about the value
 of indicators such as catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) for the monitoring of
 population status. In conjunction with limited data about the efficacy of
 measure CMM 2011-04 for limiting fishing mortality, the current
stock status of this species remains uncertain.

Here, we compared three approaches in conjunction with the current integrated
stock assessment of oceanic whitetip shark.  These approaches were catch-only
simulations, a general spatial risk assessment model, and a Bayesian dynamic
surplus production model.  We also illustrate the impact of different
assumptions on estimates of fishing mortality (*F*) and risk
(*F/F<sub>crash</sub*) to the oceanic whitetip shark stock in the
 Western and Central Pacific Ocean.

Our findings suggest that catch-only methods are most valuable as a tool to
refine Bayesian priors in more sophisticated analyses, as on their own,
catch-only methods are dependent on assumptions and provide no relevant
management outputs. Nevertheless, we show that
by making simple and relatively broad assumptions about the current
depletion level, catch alone can constrain initial (unfished and/or starting
  depletion for the catch time series) population size and productivity and,
thereby, serve as a *a priori* constraint on these parameters.

The application of dynamic surplus production models (DSPMs) showed that
these model may provide a reasonable tool to rapidly assess shark stocks,
either alongside or instead of fully integrated stock assessments. Dynamic
surplus production models can be readily applied to sharks: their implementation
 in widely-available
software packages means that they are a cost-effective
assessment tool that requires few assumptions.  In addition, these models can
provide estimates of management-relevant quantities (e.g., stock status,
  fishing mortality), which have been
shown to be robust for sharks.  Furthermore, depletion-based
catch-only simulations can be used to construct useful priors for
Bayesian implementations of these models.  Nevertheless, the reliance of DSPMs
on a reliable biomass index (e.g., CPUE time series with contrast) and
on complete removal estimates (i.e. the availability of a catch series
which accurately reflects total catch) limits their application to species for
which these
time-series data can be derived.   This aspect may exclude the application of
DSPMs to species with poor  historical identification records such as many
shark species.

We also applied a spatial risk assessment (SRA), as this approach only requires
recent catch and effort data to
estimate fishing mortality, so is less constrained by
historical data limitations. Because SRAs generally do not use
complete time series of removals, they cannot provide information about stock
status. The most commonly employed SRA  methods are conceptually similar
to fisheries surveys, as they
use estimates of gear efficiency to scale observed spatial catch to
overall catch via a spatial population density estimate. To derive
absolute fishing mortality and risk, however, these methods
need to make assumptions about the spatial interaction of the fishing
gear with the local population density. This scaling is difficult to
establish for longline gear and has a large effect on estimated risk.

For this reason, we suggest that
risk assessment methods are employed when 1) no robust time series
for catch and CPUE can be derived, and 2) it is possible to make reasonable
assumptions about the spatial effect of the fishing gear. Even with
these limitations risk assessment methods can be particularly valuable
for prioritising assessment and
conservation efforts, as they can be readily employed across species in
a standardised framework, even for species with limited historical
data.

Application of a variety of models to the oceanic whitetip shark stock
showed that DSPM, SRAs and SS3 provided similar results, but
SRA results were strongly dependent on the assumption of spatial gear
effects. All methods suggested that there is a substantial risk that
current fishing mortality remains above *F<sub>crash</sub*, the fishing
mortality that would lead to extinction in the long term  (and by extension,
well above *FF<sub>lim</sub* and *$F<sub>MSM</sub*). The SS3
assessment estimated slightly higher overall fishing mortality and
lower productivity and stock status, and therefore provides the most
pessimistic view of current fishing mortality and sustainable fishing
mortality. All methods suggest that reductions of fishing mortality
below likely values in the last year of the assessment (2016; about
45% total fishing mortality including haul-back, handling and post-release
mortality) would
substantially lower existential risks for this stock.

Based on our findings, we suggest that the Scientific Committee considers
the following:

* Inferences from different models indicate that oceanic whitetip shark
continues to be overfished, and overfishing may still be occurring
owing to incidental mortality from fishing, despite non-retention
measure CMM 2011-04. Estimated fishing mortality rates for the last
year in the assessment (2016) lead to substantial risk that the stock
will not persist.
 * Spatial risk assessment methods should be employed for
species with poor historical records (e.g., poor species
identification), but for which recent records are judged reliable. In
addition, a standardised methodology based on spatial risk assessment
methodology could be employed to prioritise assessment and conservation efforts.
* Surplus production models can provide a robust cost- and
time-effective way to assess shark populations, and provide similar
outputs to fully integrated stock assessments such as SS3. Therefore, they may
be considered as a rapid assessment tool, either alongside or
instead of fully integrated stock assessments, which could be employed
for species of high priority.
* Depletion-based catch-only simulations should be
considered for constructing priors for DSPMs and to understand the amount
of additional information provided by fitting the DSPM.
