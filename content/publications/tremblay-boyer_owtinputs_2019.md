This is a companion paper to the 2019 stock assessment for oceanic whitetip
shark (*Carcharhinus longimanus*)(Tremblay et al. 2019) detailing the historical
 catch reconstructions and CPUE standardization approaches used to create the
 data inputs to the assessment. We repeat here the methods from the main
 assessment report, provide a discussion of key results and present detailed
 model diagnostics on the observer data-based catch reconstructions and CPUE
 standardization. Other inputs to the assessment were described in
 (Tremblay et al. 2019).

Historical catches were reconstructed based on observer catch rates as
logbook-reported catches of oceanic whitetip shark were considered unreliable
over the assessment period of 1995â€“2016.  We developed a prediction-model from
observer catch rates to apply to known longline and purse-seine effort across
the Western and Central Pacific Ocean. Catches aggregated across fleets were
predicted to peak in 2001 and decline thereafter. The catches for the longline
bycatch fleet are predicted to be the highest of all fleets, with catches for
the other fleets negligible in comparison. This allocation probably reflects in
part the reliability of catch rates recorded by the observer programmes assigned
 to each fleet, as well as the effort information used to extrapolate catches.
 The catches predicted were generally higher than those estimated from the same
dataset by previous authors but predictions were also made here for CCMs that
are typically excluded from these analyses due to a poor characterization of effort.
The catch predictions otherwise showed good agreement for key years with an
alternative time series that was developed based on global fin trade statistics.

A single standardized index was developed for this assessment based on the
longline bycatch fleet following discussions at the 2019 Pre-Assessment Workshop
 (PAW) (Pilling & Brouwer 2019). This fleet was chosen as the underlying data
 were deemed the most reliable of those available, and also covered the greatest
  extent within the assessment region. The standardized year effects resulting
  from the CPUE model were highly variable at the start of the time series
  and started steadily declining from 1999 onwards. Influential covariates in
  the model included sea surface temperature, hooks-between-float as
a proxy for set depth, species targeting cluster and observer programme.

The analyses presented here included years from the earlier period of observer
programmes in the WCPO. Observer reporting for sharks for this period is known
to be unreliable as well as highly variable given the sparse coverage. Any
results for this early time period must be interpreted carefully. In addition,
we found evidence of observer programmes having an impact on recorded catch
rates independent from vessel flag, such that observer training, as would be
expected, is a likely influence on the catch rates recorded for sharks across
time and programmes. As this is a variable that is challenging to quantify and
so cannot be standardized for, the results presented here should be interpreted
in light of this caveat.
