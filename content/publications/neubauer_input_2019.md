title: Input data for the 2018 stock assessment of pāua (<i>Haliotis iris</i>) for
		  PAU 5D
---

This report describes the data inputs to the 2018 stock assessment of
New Zealand abalone,  pāua (*Haliotis iris*), in quota management
area (QMA) PAU 5D. The PAU 5D QMA covers the
eastern coast of Southland and the Otago coast.
Data inputs to the stock assessment were catch,
catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE), catch sampling length frequency from commercial
sampling (CSLF), growth data from tagging, and maturity.  There were three
years of additional data
since the preceding assessment in 2016, e.g., catch data from 2015–16,
2016–17 and 2017–18.

The 2018 stock assessment also included a number of developments
and updates to the modelling
approach for CPUE, CSLF and growth and maturity data.
For CPUE data, two previously separate time series with different
resolutions for key covariates were merged by specifying the
relationship between the two resolutions within the model structure.
The accuracy of the effort variable was also improved by accounting
for the probability that diver effort was reported individually or at
the level of the crew. For the length-frequency composition data
(CSLF), samples were standardised assuming a Dirichlet-Multinomial
error distribution instead of rescaling them as in previous stock
assessments. For the growth model, a new formulation based on
a meta-analysis of growth across all pāua QMAs led to a new, less
informative growth prior for population-wide growth in PAU 5D.
