Seabirds are incidentally captured in New Zealand commercial fisheries,
including bottom-longline fisheries targeting snapper and bluenose in northern
North Island. Incidental captures of protected species, such as seabirds, are
recorded by fishers and also by government fisheries observers when they are
onboard commercial vessels.  Nevertheless, the rates of these incidental
captures are uncertain, as fisher-reported records may be incomplete
and observer coverage of these bottom-longline fisheries is variable.  

For this reason, a pilot electronic monitoring programme was implemented in October
2016 (the 2016â€“17 fishing year) in bottom-longline fisheries targeting
snapper and bluenose in north-eastern North Island (the Hauraki Gulf and
Bay of Plenty areas, Fisheries Management Area
FMA 1).  The fisheries in this area overlap with the spatial distribution of black petrel (*Procellaria parkinsoni*),
which has been identified as the species most at risk from commercial fisheries in
New Zealand.  Black petrel breed on Little Barrier and Great Barrier islands in
Hauraki Gulf during summer, and use the outer Hauraki Gulf area and pelagic waters
for foraging during that time.

During the electronic monitoring programme, the haul of the catch was recorded using
 cameras onboard participating vessels, and the footage was subsequently reviewed.
 Here, we used a modelling approach to assess whether fisher-reported seabird captures were
 affected by the presence of onboard cameras.

 We found that the rate of fisher-reported seabird captures increased from 0.0044
 birds per thousand hooks before the trial to 0.0089 birds per thousand hooks during
 the trial for the vessels that participated in the camera trial for the snapper target
 fishery. This increase of around a factor of two was also supported by
 a statistical analysis. Key candidate model structures showed a positive effect of
 onboard cameras on the reporting of seabird capture rates: the model estimated
 that fisher reporting of seabird captures in the pilot programme fleet was
 around twice as high when vessels had onboard cameras than when they were
 without cameras (the median effect was 1.6 times higher when the analysis was
 restricted to vessels in the pilot programme, and 2.2 times higher when the
 whole fleet was included in the analysis). There was a 99.9% probability that
 the fisher-reporting rate increased during the trial for the analysis
 extended to the whole fleet.

 To date, fisher-reported captures have not been used in the estimation
 of the impact of fishing on seabirds, due to the low reporting rates and
 potential limitations with species identification. Further data, both from observers and from an ongoing camera trial, will help to
 improve our understanding of variations in fisher-reporting rates in the bottom-longline fishery.
