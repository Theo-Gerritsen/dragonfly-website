The deployment of independent fisheries observers is widely recognised as
a key component of best practice fisheries management. In New Zealand,
observers have been a critical component of the commercial fisheries
management regime since the 1990s. The data collection approaches
and protocols used by observers in New Zealand fisheries have generally
become more detailed over time, as well as covering a greater number and
diversity of protected species groups and fishing gears.
Here, we review the strategic framework that generates information needs
that may be addressed by fisheries observers and evaluate current observer
data collection protocols in that context. The review covers international
and national agreements, legislation, policies, management plans, and
international approaches to observer data collection, as well as manuals,
briefing notes, protocols, and forms used by observers in New Zealand
fisheries.

Broadly, the strategic documents reviewed focused on the achievement of
sustainability in environmental management and/or the conservation of
biological diversity. Information needs that creates for New Zealand in
relation to commercial fisheries encompass the characteristics of the fishing
operations, the nature and extent of protected species captures, the status
of captured animals, the operational and environmental factors that may
contribute to captures, and, measures in place to avoid or reduce captures.

Protocols and forms currently used by observers to collect data from
New Zealand fisheries partially address these information needs. Scope
for improvements includes ensuring clarity and consistency in observer
instructions, the addition of new fields or amendments to current fields
on current data collection forms, the creation of new forms to capture
additional information, and, the discontinuation of forms, fields, and
metrics that are redundant or no longer useful. Priority areas in which to
improve information collection relate to longline gear and protected species
bycatch mitigation, purse seine gear and protected species interactions,
mitigation of seabird strikes on trawl warps, cryptic mortality of protected
species interacting with commercial fisheries, and coral bycatch. However,
the most significant current impediment to meeting information needs is
the paucity of observer coverage achieved in some fisheries, especially
smaller-vessel fisheries operating in inshore areas. For those fisheries, our
limited understanding of protected species interactions compromises New
Zealandâ€™s ability to deliver on domestic and international obligations.

To progress the work described in this report, at-sea testing of the proposed
forms is required. Overall, regular review of the data collection approaches
observers implement, combined with ensuring effective coverage of New
Zealand commercial fisheries, will maximise the current and future benefits
gained from observer deployments.
