1.  Whether plants use leaf colour to deter herbivores remains controversial. The warning signal hypothesis predicts
that red pigmentation is adaptive by reducing herbivory; plants with predominantly red foliage should
have higher fitness than those with green leaves. Despite many discussions, this prediction has rarely been
tested, and alternative, non-exclusive hypotheses cannot be ruled out.
2.  We have exploited leaf colour polymorphism in *Pseudowintera colorata* to test the warning signal hypothesis
and to address possible alternative explanations.
3.  Consistent with warning signals, redder foliage contained higher concentrations of polygodial, a sesquiterpene
dialdehyde with strong antifeedant properties, and incurred less herbivory than green leaves. Redder plants
hosted 22% fewer lepidopteran leafroller larvae than neighbouring green plants.
4.  However, contrary to the predictions of the hypothesis, there were no differences in fitness parameters
between red and green plants. Overall leaf canopy colour was not a significant predictor of the number of seeds
per fruit or of mean seed weight. This may be explained by differences in photosynthesis: green *P. colorata*
leaves had 47% higher maximum CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates than matched red leaves from neighbouring plants.

5.  These results indicate that the benefits of deterring insect herbivores by signalling may be balanced by the
higher photosynthetic rate of non-signalling plants. A balance between signalling and photosynthesis is a novel
mechanism for the maintenance of leaf colour polymorphisms in nature.
6.  Synthesis. Anthocyanin pigments may simultaneously serve multiple functions within leaves, and individuals
of the same plant species may use different strategies to cope with insect herbivores. Therefore, investigations
into the role of these pigments in plantâ€“insect interactions need to consider plant physiology and the diversity
of plant defence mechanisms.
