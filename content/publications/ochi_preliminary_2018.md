This document presents the preliminary results of applying the Spatially Explicit
Fisheries Risk Assessment framework (SEFRA) developed by New Zealand to assessing
the total mortality of great albatross caused by tuna longline operations in the southern
hemisphere. The impacts of these mortalities on the sustainability of these albatross
species are also considered. Seabird bycatch was modelled as a multiplier of a temporal
and spatial overlap between fishing and seabird distributions. Seabird catchability,
defined as a combination of seabird-specific vulnerability to fishing gears and gearspecific
seabird catchability, was first estimated using the Japanese and New Zealand onboard
observer data, and then applied to the total fishing efforts in the southern
hemisphere for assessment of total annual bycatch mortality (ABM). High ABMs and
high expected risks of longline bycatch to seabird population were identified in
particular for wandering albatross, among seven species examined, even though the
results were considered preliminary. The analysis demonstrated the capacity of SEFRA
to deliver robust estimates of ABM and their impacts to seabird population from limited
observer bycatch data, although some constraints and uncertainties, in particular for
rarely caught species, remained. The authors intend to further develop the methodology
and invite interested WCPFC members to join the collaboration.
