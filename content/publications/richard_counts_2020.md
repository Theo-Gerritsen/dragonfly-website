Many seabird species are experiencing a global decline, with incidental mortalities in
commercial fisheries considered one of the main causes. While the high seabird diversity
in New Zealand waters has been widely recognised, the distribution of many species remains
largely unknown. In addition, current estimates of seabird bycatch within New Zealand's
Exclusive Economic Zone lack distribution data for the majority of species, with model
estimates based on the assumption that seabird distributions are spatially uniform, at
least within large areas. Statistical bycatch models could be greatly improved if observed
captures could be related to the number of seabirds present around fishing vessels.

Counts of the number of seabirds present around commercial fishing vessels in New Zealand
waters have been carried out by government observers in a relatively consistent framework,
and recorded on paper forms. Another type of counts by observers were recorded on Nomad
electronic devices under a different protocol. The data from 2007--08 to 2018--19 in both
datasets were processed and groomed to correct inconsistencies and mistakes made during
the data collection. Here, a summary of seabird abundance and distribution data are
presented, including comparisons of observer data with other data sources. Some
preliminary exploration of the data is also presented, including its limitations and
suggestions to improve the value of data collected in the future. Furthermore, an Internet
website was created to make the dataset publicly available, including distribution maps of
seabirds by species or species group within New Zealand's Exclusive Economic Zone.
