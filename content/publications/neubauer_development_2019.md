title: Development and evaluation of management procedures in
pāua quota management areas 5A, 5B and 5D
---

This project was a first attempt at introducing formal management
procedures (MPs) based on control rules in pāua fisheries in New
Zealand. Stakeholders in pāua quota management area PAU 5 requested
that science-based management procedures be investigated in order to
ensure long-term sustainability of pāua fisheries in lower South Island
and Stewart Island. The MPs were to be used for voluntary management within
the industry
in the medium term (e.g., for the next 3–5 years) to trial the
process.  Once the process and the MPs were refined and meeting
stakeholders' expectations, they could be used for setting the total
allowable commercial catch (TACC).

The development process for the MPs included three phases: initially,
the current pāua stock assessment model was used to produce
up-to-date status estimates for all stocks, and an added MP evaluation
loop was used to test preliminary rules. The outcome of this pilot run
was the basis for the development of a web application that was used to consult
with fishers and inspect the outcomes of individual model runs.

A series of meetings was held with fishers and quota-owners in PAU 5 to
quantify objectives and identify control rules that are acceptable to stakeholders.
Management objectives were stated qualitatively as low risk/high biomass
objectives, and rules were discussed that fishers considered as leading
to desirable outcomes (i.e., high biomass and low risk in the context of the
management objectives).

Agreed rules were simulation-tested based on the period 2016–2036
using the pāua stock assessment model.  This testing involved a number of
scenarios, including scenarios that were explicitly requested by PAU 5 stakeholders
(e.g., scenarios relating to increased recreational catch). The MP evaluations
showed that rules suggested by fishers are likely robust, and near optimal with
respect to identified objectives for PAU~5A and PAU~5B. For both these fisheries,
the proposed rules led to likely outcomes of biomass levels above 40% of virgin
spawning stock biomass SSB<sub>0</sub>.

In PAU 5B, the proposed rule could be used to motivate an increase in TACC,
as all scenarios suggest continued rebuilding of biomass towards a level near
60% of spawning stock biomass and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) around
50 kg/h. In PAU 5A, the proposed control rules would likely  lead to
steady increases in biomass to levels well above 40% of SSB<sub>0</sub>.  
Nevertheless, the rules also suggested that the current shelving needs to
be maintained under conservative management objectives.

The proposed control rule for PAU 5D likely leads to steady
rebuilding, but there is only a small chance that biomass levels will
be above 40% of SSB<sub>0</sub> in the medium term, despite current
shelving of 30% of the TACC. Under the proposed control rule,
shelving levels would likely be reduced relatively quickly, and an
agreement to maintain current shelving levels would help faster
rebuilding. The evaluation of the MPs thus suggested a difficult
trade-off in PAU 5D between continued catch and rapid rebuilding to
target levels.

The proposed control rules appear to be a robust starting point for
managing PAU 5 fisheries on the basis of formal, but voluntary,
management procedures. Most sensitivities, including those with increased
recreational catch, had limited impact for the sustainability of the
PAU 5 fisheries under the proposed rules. Increased recreational catch
did lead to lower commercial catch in these scenarios, but over-all,
reduced productivity (through low future recruitment) had the
strongest impact on performance of control rules and often led to declines
in biomass under rules considered here. However, only in PAU 5D did
simulated declines under reduced productivity lead to high probability of
triggering limit reference points.
