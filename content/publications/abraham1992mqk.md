Time-dependent solutions, called *Q*-kinks, of certain (1+1)-dimensional sigma-models with scalar potentials are shown to have many properties in common with BPS dyons of (3+1)-dimensional Yang-Mills/Higgs theory. In particular, sigma-model analogues of the phenomena of fractionally charged dyons and of charge-exchange between dyons and axion domain walls are described. In 2+1 dimensions *Q*-kinks become *Q*-strings. We show that the recently discovered *Q*-lumps of the (2+1)-dimensional model can be considered to be stable loops of *Q*-string.
