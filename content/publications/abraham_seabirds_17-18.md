New Zealand waters support a diverse range of seabird species, which frequently interact with fisheries
throughout the region. Some of these interactions result in the incidental capture and mortality of seabirds
in different commercial fisheries. Fisheries observers onboard commercial fishing vessels record this
bycatch of seabirds, documenting the number and species that are getting caught. These observer records
allow the estimation of total seabird captures, forming the basis of bycatch assessments in New Zealand's
Exclusive Economic Zone.

The current analysis provides the most recent annual assessment of seabird captures in New Zealand
waters, including data from the 2017–18 fishing year. The analysis used statistical models to derive
estimates of total seabird captures across all commercial trawl and longline fisheries, applying a unified
modelling framework to estimate incidental captures of seabirds. It followed the same approach as recent
bycatch assessments, but an overdispersion scaling parameter was included in the current model update.
This parameter took a value between zero and two: with a value of zero, the distribution of captures was
assumed to follow a negative binomial distribution (as previously); with a value of two, the variance in
the distribution of captures was proportional to the mean (similar to a Poisson distribution). The mean
value of the posterior distribution of the overdispersion scaling parameters in the fitted models ranged
from 0.54 to 1.27. This new parameter resulted in marked decreases in the uncertainty for a number of
total seabird capture estimates.

Included in the modelling were ten species and species groups: New Zealand white-capped albatross
(*Thalassarche steadi*), Salvin's albatross (*Thalassarche salvini*), Buller's albatross (*Thalassarche bulleri*,
combining both southern *T. b. bulleri* and northern *T. b. platei* subspecies), white-chinned petrel (*Procellaria aequinoctialis*), black petrel (*Procellaria parkinsoni*), grey petrel (*Procellaria cinerea*), sooty
shearwater (*Puffinus griseus*), flesh-footed shearwater (*Puffinus carneipes*), and ''other albatrosses'' and
“other birds”. The time periods of the current estimation were the fishing years from 2002–03 to 2017–18
for trawl fisheries, and from 1998–99 to 2017–18 for longline fisheries.

There was a total of 3328 (95% c.i.: 2971–3782) estimated seabird captures in trawl and longline fisheries
(c.i., credible interval, the 95th quantile range of the posterior distribution) in 2017–18. The total estimate
included 1506 (95% c.i.: 1344–1696) seabird captures in trawl fisheries, 1186 (95% c.i.: 913–1589)
captures in bottom-longline fisheries, and 635 (95% c.i.: 536–758) captures in surface-longline fisheries.
The highest number of total estimated captures in 2017–18 was of white-chinned petrel, with 681 (95%
c.i.: 486–1040) estimated captures of this species. The second highest estimate was 462 (95% c.i.: 383–
565) captures of New Zealand white-capped albatross, followed by 426 (95% c.i.: 321–554) captures of
flesh-footed shearwater. Capture estimates for other species included 350 (95% c.i.: 256–474) captures
of Salvin's albatross, 242 (95% c.i.: 159–369) captures of black petrel, 231 (95% c.i.: 181–295) captures
of Buller’s albatrosses, 213 (95% c.i.: 143–322) captures of sooty shearwater, and 139 (95% c.i.: 62–
293) captures of grey petrel. In addition to estimates for individual species, there were 331 (95% c.i.:
255–431) captures of other birds and 249 (95% c.i.: 181–340) captures of other albatrosses.

For eight of the ten modelled species groups, the total number of estimated captures decreased between
2002–03 and 2017–18. The exceptions were white-chinned petrel and grey petrel, for which the total
number of estimated captures did not show a clear decrease over this time period. When estimated captures in 2017–18 were compared with estimates in 2006–07, after mandatory mitigation measures were
introduced in trawl fisheries in January 2006), the former estimates were similar to those in 2006–07
for many species. Capture estimates for all species groups combined showed a clear decrease over the
assessment period, with the lowest mean number of seabird captures in the reporting period in 2017–18.
These decreases were largely determined by marked decreases in fishing effort.

There were sufficient numbers of captures in large-vessel fisheries to examine temporal trends in capture
rates (number of captures per unit fishing effort). Patterns over time varied, depending on the fishing
method and target fishery, and between albatrosses and petrels. These patterns included a decrease in
albatross capture rates (number of captures per unit fishing effort) in squid and in hoki trawl fisheries
in 2006, immediately following the introduction of mandatory warp mitigation; however, capture rates
subsequently increased or showed no clear trend in more recent years. For petrels in the squid trawl
fishery, capture rates exhibited a distinct pattern of higher captures in alternate years, but the reason for
these fluctuations is unknown.

The estimation of seabird captures relies on data collected by onboard fisheries observers, but observer
coverage and effort varied considerably across fishing methods and vessel sizes over the reporting period.
Increasing observer coverage in the small-vessel fleets, and ensuring that all vessels have at least some
observer coverage, would help to ensure that estimates based on observer data reliably reflect seabird
bycatch in New Zealand's commercial trawl and longline fisheries.
