title: The 2018 stock assessment of pāua (<i>Haliotis iris</i>) for PAU 5D
---
We conducted a Bayesian length-based stock assessment for
pāua (*Haliotis iris*) in pāua quota
management area PAU 5D. The assessment model used the same population
dynamics model as previous assessments, but the data models that
linked the population dynamics (process) model with
different data types were significantly updated. Unlike previous
assessments, the present model used only model-derived inputs and did
not fit directly to data. It, therefore, represents a Bayesian
synthesis of available information rather than an integrated model
that fits to data directly. This development is most significant for
the growth process as represented in the model, which previously relied
on fitting directly to available data from particular quota management areas.
In this
model, growth information was given in the form of a rather vague
prior, and the model used this information with other inputs to
estimate stock-level growth. This approach led to slower estimated growth
across all models that were considered to be robust (by the
Fisheries New Zealand Shellfish Working Group), which in turn resulted
in higher estimated spawning stock biomass.

Other changes in the current stock assessment included a new
Dirichlet-Multinomial/Multivariate-Normal formulation for catch
sampling length frequency (CSLF) data, and estimation of
process error for both CSLF and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE)
inputs.

Relative weighting between these inputs was achieved via explicit constraints on
information loss in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) for the two
main input sources (CPUE and CSLF). The KLD was then used to calculate
posterior information loss in the model for both input types, and to
adjust weights in favour of one or the other input.

Two sets of relative weights and two sets of priors for natural mortality $M$ were
selected as the main sensitivity runs alongside a base case that gave
slightly more weight to CPUE data. Both the base case and the two main
sensitivity runs suggested that the stock status was near or at 40% of
the unfished spawning stock. For all models, however, the relative available
biomass was relatively low (near 25%). Projections at current catch
levels suggest that rebuilding towards higher levels of available
biomass will be likely to be relatively slow despite current voluntary
shelving of 35\% of the allowable commercial catch.
