New Zealand has been utilising and refining a spatially explicit assessment of
risk to seabirds from commercial fishing since 2009. This framework has been
applied to the main fishing methods; trawl, surface and bottom longline and setnet,
within the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). New Zealand has been intending to
extend this risk assessment framework to a broader set of fisheries, as seabirds migrate
widely and interact with a wide range of fisheries across multiple EEZ and Regional Fisheries Management
Organisations (RFMOs).

This paper presents progress on the extended risk assessment framework to date,
applying the methodology to public tuna RFMO fishing data from throughout the Southern
Hemisphere. Seabirds included in the risk assessment were 26 species that breed
in the Southern Hemisphere and are listed under the Agreement on the Conservation of
Albatrosses and Petrels.
