Most marine animals have a pelagic larval phase that develops in the coastal or open
ocean. The fate of larvae has profound effects on replenishment of marine populations that
are critical for human and ecosystem health. Larval ecology is expected to be tightly coupled
to oceanic features, but for most taxa we know little about the interactions between larvae
and the pelagic environment. Here, we provide evidence that surface slicks, a common coastal
convergence feature, provide nursery habitat for diverse marine larvae, including > 100 species
of commercially and ecologically important fishes.

The vast majority of invertebrate and larval fish taxa sampled had mean densities 2–110 times higher
in slicks than in ambient water. Combining in-situ surveys with remote sensing, we estimate that
slicks contain 39% of neustonic larval fishes, 26% of surface-dwelling zooplankton (prey), and 75%
of foating organic debris (shelter) in our 1000 km2 study area in Hawai‘i. Results indicate late-larval
fishes actively select slick habitats to capitalize on concentrations of diverse prey and shelter. By
providing these survival advantages, surface slicks enhance larval supply and replenishment of adult
populations from coral reef, epipelagic, and deep-water ecosystems. Our findings suggest that slicks
play a critically important role in enhancing productivity in tropical marine ecosystems.
