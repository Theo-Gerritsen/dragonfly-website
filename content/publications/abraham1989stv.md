The action for an extended object (string, membrane, etc) can be written in a form
that is worldsheet or worldvolume (super)-Weyl invariant. We show that, as a consequence,
such actions are never spacetime conformal invariant. In contrast, we also show that the
action for a massless particle of spin 0, 4, or 1, in an arbitrary spacetime background has
symmetries corresponding to conformal isometries of the background, precisely because of
the absence of worldline (super)-Weyl invariance.
