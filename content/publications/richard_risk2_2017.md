This supplementary information presents a summary of population and distributional data for the 71 taxa
included in the risk assessment of the impact of fishing-related mortalities on seabirds breeding in the
New Zealand region.

For each seabird taxon included in the risk assessment, the demographic parameters used were the New
Zealand population size, the age at first reproduction, and the survival rate. These data are included
here with an assigned index of quality (poor, medium, high). For species for which no demographic
estimates were available, values from proxy species were used, as indicated with a reference to the data
source. Distributional data are presented as maps of the at-sea distribution of each species, with separate
maps for the non-breeding and breeding distributions. The distribution of non-breeders was derived from
existing maps published by NABIS (National Aquatic Biodiversity Information System) and BirdLife
International. A single distribution map was generated when the breeding season extended throughout
the year. Included in the distributional maps are data of any incidental captures in commercial trawl,
longline and set-net fisheries between the 2006–07 and 2014–15 fishing years, recorded by fisheries
observers.

The derived parameters as used in the calculations for the risk assessment are also included. Included
with each derived parameter is the density distribution, with the red line indicating the mean, and blue
lines indicating the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles. A detailed description of the methods used to derive the
data presented here is provided in the main document.
