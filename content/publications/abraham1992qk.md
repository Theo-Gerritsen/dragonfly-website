Certain (4,4)-supersymmetric (1+1)-dimensional sigma-models admit a scalar potential. We exhibit models of this type for which there are static particle-like solutions stabilized by a three-vector topological charge *Q*. These solutions form a special class of (generally time-dependent) “*Q*-kink” solutions stabilized by a quaternionic charge *Q* = (*Q*<sub>0</sub>, *<b>Q</b>*), where *Q*<sub>0</sub> is a Noether charge. *Q*-kinks saturate a Bogomol'nyi-type bound and break half the supersymmetry. As solutions of a four-dimensional field theory they constitute examples of type II supermembranes.
