Emma has spent most of her career working as a freelance ecologist, 
she completed her undergraduate study and postgraduate diploma in Zoology at Massey University.

Emma Crawford has had a passion for ecology for as long as she can remember. 
“When I was little I was always out in the garden lifting up logs and rocks, searching for 
insects and all sorts of creatures. It’s funny, as an ecologist, I do the exact same thing now.”

Emma spent most of her career in the field as a freelance ecologist, 
bouncing between the United Kingdom and New Zealand. In the United Kingdom, 
Emma's work involved surveying amphibians, reptiles and bats. She has also 
completed many hours of desk-based sound analysis identifying British bats.

Her work in New Zealand has covered bird and botanical surveys, the captive 
rearing of kiwi chicks for Operation Nest Egg, and field and lab work for 
Dragonfly’s intertidal shellfish monitoring.

Outside of work, Emma enjoys photography, tramping and writing. Her and
her partner’s blog, Zoomology, captures their numerous adventures and encounters
with wildlife across the globe.

Emma is especially looking forward to being involved in the entirety of a project with Dragonfly.
“Often I just collect the field data and send it off, so it's exciting to think that soon
I’ll see what actually happens to it.”
