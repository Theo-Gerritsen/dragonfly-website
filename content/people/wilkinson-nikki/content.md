Nikki is a data scientist at Dragonfly – she has a strong interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

She has a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics and statistics (including a minor in data science) from Victoria University of Wellington and previously worked as a ski instructor and a chef.

After completing an Honours degree in late 2020, Nikki will continue with a PhD at Victoria University while working at Dragonfly. She plans to explore machine learning approaches to risk modelling via a cross-sectoral social investment approach. Her research will have applications in epidemiological and intervention studies.

Nikki believes that considering security and ethics when managing data is becoming more and more important.

> When you’re dealing with data, you have to remember the people behind it and what you’re doing it for. There’s always a story behind the data – it’s not just numbers.
