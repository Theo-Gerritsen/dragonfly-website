She has a bachelor of science degree in marine biology from Te Herenga Waka (Victoria University of Wellington) and is currently studying for a masters degree in marine conservation. During her studies Tyla completed internships at the Ministry for the Environment and GNS Science.

While continuing to practice her coding skills with the team, she is also helping build their confidence and ability in speaking te reo Māori.

Tyla says she carries this proverb with her.

> Kia tipu, kia hua, kia puāwai – to grow, to prosper, to sustain. This describes my journey into the world of data science where there are many pūkenga (skills) and mātauranga (knowledge) to grab hold of. I’m looking forward to the future and where data science will take us.”
