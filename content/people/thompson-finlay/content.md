Finlay has extensive experience as a database and software developer. He leads 
the technical direction of Dragonfly's work, with a strong focus on open source
technologies. He enjoys the challenge of making analytical and 
statistical solutions operational. 

Finlay is experienced in Bayesian analysis and has carryied out statistical modelling
on diverse projects such as estimating the bycatch of marine mammals in New Zealand fisheries, and
the number of leaky homes in the country. He believes that automated approaches can massively increase the quality, reproducibility, and productivity of analytical systems, 
bringing significant savings to clients. 

Finlay researched four dimensional algebra and geometry for his PhD in 
mathematics at [SISSA](http://sissa.it), Italy. He completed post-docs at [CIMAT](http://www.cimat.mx/) in Mexico 
and [Victoria University of Wellington](http://www.victoria.ac.nz/sms),
then worked in Wellington's IT industry before joining Dragonfly in 2008. 

> I think decision making should be supported with the best available 
information. Data collection can be an expensive
investment for any organisation, so getting the most from that data
is essential. In the long run, robust analysis will produce a better return on
investment. It's gratifying to see our work being used to inform key commercial and
government decisions.
