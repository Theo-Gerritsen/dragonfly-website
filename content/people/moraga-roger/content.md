Roger is a research bioinformatician with experience in genomics, next
generation sequencing and biological sequence analysis.

<!--more-->

He has a master of science degree in bioinformatics from Exeter University,
England and a bachelor of science degree in molecular biology from the
Autonomous University of Madrid, Spain. He started [Tea Break Bioinformatics](http://tenformatics.com/index.html) in 2018 and previously worked at AgResearch in Palmerston North, Proteome Sciences in Frankfurt, Germany and deCODE Genetics
 in Reyjkavik, Iceland.

Roger has used many different tools and algorithms to analyse a wide variety of
 biological datasets. This training and experience enables him to choose and
 adapt existing tools to resolve novel biological questions.


> The question, ‘what do you want to do with your genome?’ is always a good
place to start. Then identify your research question, follow up with the right
tool and explore the data you have. Trying to do everything at once is often
a bad idea!
