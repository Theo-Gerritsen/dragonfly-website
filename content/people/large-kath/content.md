Kath is a fisheries scientist whose work involves building computer models of complex fish interactions to understand the effects of fishing on the environment.

She enjoys the technical nature of the job, particularly constructing models that make sense in the real world and are useful. Kath values input from other experts with direct experience of fish behaviour and knowledge about how fisheries operate.

Kath most recently worked at NIWA as a fisheries analyst and modeller. She has a master of science in statistics from Victoria University of Wellington and bachelors degrees in science and applied science.

> I think being inquisitive is really important, even though it can lead you down a rabbit hole sometimes. Only by taking time can we be sure our models aren’t missing anything, or be confident we've found something new if they don’t line up with what we know already.
