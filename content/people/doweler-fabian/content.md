Fabian is a geospatial analyst and ecologist who studies large-scale change in
ecosystems with modern imaging and mapping techniques.

<!--more-->

He uses remote sensing methods like thermal, multispectral imagery and LiDAR to
map changes across landscapes. Fabian has a particular interest in the impacts
of climate change on shifts in the boundaries of ecosystems.

Fabian has a PhD from Auckland University of Technology. For his thesis, he
studied abrupt treeline patterns in the Southern Alps using a combination of
drone imagery, plant physiology and agent-based modelling. Before coming to
New Zealand, Fabian was part of the EnvEuro masters programme. He majored in
climate change and water resources, and studied the effects of coastal erosion
on shoreline ecosystems in Sarawak, Malaysia for his thesis.
