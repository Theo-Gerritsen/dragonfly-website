Would you like to join our team?

<!--more-->

We are a growing data science consultancy with a range of public
and private sector clients. While our office is in Wellington, some of our
staff work remotely from other parts of Aotearoa New Zealand.

One of the hallmarks of our company is collaboration â€“ we take pride in our
ability to work together. We draw on people's substantial expertise across
domains, so while individuals are responsible for particular projects, the outputs are
the products of our team. This approach enables us to deliver outputs that
exceed expectations, and we're personally and professionally proud of the
quality of the work we produce.

We use advanced statistical and machine learning techniques, make extensive use
of cloud computing, wrangle large data sets and build beautiful data-rich
visualisations and reports. We are committed to using reproducible methods in
all our work.

We are an inclusive and friendly company, with a focus on collaboration and
innovation. We strive to provide an excellent work environment.
