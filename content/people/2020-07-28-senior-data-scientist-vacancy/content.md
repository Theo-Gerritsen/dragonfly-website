We are looking for an experienced data scientist who is skilled in the
development and application of machine learning methods to natural language
problems.  Knowledge of te reo and tikanga Māori or other Polynesian languages
is desired but is not required. 

We seek a data scientist with experience relevant to the development of:

* Speech recognition for te reo Māori using Mozilla Deep Speech
* Speech synthesis for te reo Māori
* Models of Natural Language Understanding 
* Speech recognition in multilingual contexts

The work is part of the Papa Reo project, which aims to use machine learning
methods to develop digital tools for te reo Māori, and to support indigenous
communities globally in revitalising their languages. The work will require
development of machine learning models and their integration into operational
systems. The current focus is on automatic speech recognition (using Mozilla
Deep Speech) and on voice synthesis. It is anticipated that the scope will widen
to include models of natural language understanding (that could be used, for
example, to respond to queries in te reo Māori), and to be applied in
multilingual contexts (such as a mix of te reo Māori and New Zealand English). 

Papa Reo is led by [Te Hiku Media](https://tehiku.nz), in collaboration with Dragonfly Data Science,
with the Mozilla machine learning team, and with university researchers. The
seven-year programme is funded by the New Zealand Ministry of Business,
Innovation & Employment’s [Strategic Science Investment Fund](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/science-and-technology/science-and-innovation/funding-information-and-opportunities/investment-funds/strategic-science-investment-fund/), 
which aims to increase New
Zealand’s data science capability. The role will also include collaboration and
mentoring of junior researchers. The work will include publication in the
primary literature, and academic experience is welcomed. 

This is a unique opportunity to join a multi-organisational team that is led by
Māori, is answerable to the community, and that includes software developers,
PhD students, linguists, and  academic researchers. There is also the
opportunity to become involved with Dragonfly’s broader work in the area of
natural language processing. 

The role is offered as a permanent full-time position, with salary depending on
experience. The role is New Zealand based. Dragonfly has an office in
Wellington, and staff based in Auckland who are working on Papa Reo.

To apply for this position, please send a cover letter (a maximum of two pages),
a curriculum vitae and examples of recent research outputs to Edward Abraham
([edward@dragonfly.co.nz](edward@dragonfly.co.nz)). International applicants are asked to check their visa
eligibility on the Immigration New Zealand website. Because of COVID-19, there
is currently limited immigration to New Zealand, however highly-qualified
applicants may be eligible to enter New Zealand under the "other critical worker"
category.

Applications close at 9 am, Monday August 17, 2020.
