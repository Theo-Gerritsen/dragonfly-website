Ian is a cartographer and geospatial data specialist who enjoys translating
messy datasets into useful, manageable information.

<!--more-->

He is skilled in both data processing and map making. Ianâ€™s work ranges from the
 problem-solving aspects of processing large datasets all the way through to
 presenting data in maps and images. He aims to provide geospatial information
 in a way that highlights details and important insights and communicates to a
 wide audience.

Ian started [XYCarto](https://xycarto.com) in 2020 to provide contract geospatial
 and cartographic services. Before that he worked at
  [Land Information New Zealand](linz.govt.nz) as a senior spatial analyst on
  the proof of concept for their first national base map. Other roles have
  included developing 3D software for [Geographx](https://geographx.co.nz/) and
  work as an analyst in the [AidData](aiddata.org) research lab at the College
  of William and Mary in Virginia.

Ian has a master of science in landscape architecture from Pennsylvania State
University. He researched the use of natural methods to clean water in urban
spaces, which required the use of hydrological mapping techniques. Ian also has
 a degree in mechanical engineering and credits his interest in green urban
 design with work for a structural engineering firm.


> Geospatial work is the perfect balance of art and science. No two problems are
 the same and I get great satisfaction from using my artistic side to present
 information beautifully. I have the pleasure of working across a multitude of
 fields, helping professionals deliver good science in compelling visualisations.
