Pep is design lead at Dragonfly, and a digital design consultant for his agency
Salted Herring.

<!-- more -->

He is responsible for applying a robust design process to our digital products &
projects. This ultimately ensures an intuitive and engaging user-experience in
the often very complex and abstract [models/data sets/stories] we create.

He has been designing and art directing digital projects for over 20 years and
began collaborating with Dragonfly around 10 years ago. Some of the projects he
has been involved with are MBIE's Regional Economic Activity Report, the Bycatch
Management Information Tool, and Kōkako Language Tracking Tool, which won NZ's
most prestigious interactive design award, the BeST Purple Pin in 2016.

After graduating with honours in graphic design at the Royal Academy of Arts in
The Netherlands, Pep worked as a digital designer at agencies in the Hague,
Wellington, London and Amsterdam. He started Salted Herring in 2007 when he
moved back to NZ and with partner Kate Handley, built it into a studio with a
reputation for delivering distinctive, effective and highly crafted digital
work. Some of the clients include: Whittaker's Chocolate, the Asia NZ
Foundation, the NZ Festival, Totara Learn, ComplyWith and many SaaS start-ups.
