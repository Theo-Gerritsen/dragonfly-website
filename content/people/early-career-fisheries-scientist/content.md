We are looking for an early-career fisheries scientist with data analysis and
modelling skills to contribute to projects related to fisheries and their
environmental impacts (e.g., bycatch) in New Zealand and internationally.

The ideal candidate is excited about working in fisheries and marine ecology,
and is comfortable performing data analyses for fisheries problems across
different contexts.  Responsibilities in this role include generating summaries
of fisheries-related data from databases, analysing data using statistical
models (e.g., GLM/GLMMs), and building analysis frameworks for fisheries
projects. Our Linux-based toolchain revolves around open-source software such
as R, Python, PostgresSQL. We prefer candidates who have actively used these
tools.

Candidates will have an M.Sc. with some research experience (e.g., M.Sc. by
thesis with a quantitative fisheries dissertation), or a Ph.D. in a relevant
field, such as fisheries, quantitative ecology, or applied statistics. We
encourage applications by recent graduates, but also value relevant work
experience.

This role may require communication with a wide range of stakeholders,
including other researchers, non-government organisations, government agencies,
and industry representatives. We are looking for a thoughtful and effective
communicator, who is able to make their work relevant to a broad range of
audiences.  Communication skills will include the ability to produce
high-quality writing, including visually-striking and effective graphs.

Some of our recent fisheries projects include:

  * research on the impact of climate change on marine ecosystems,
  * developing spatial models for New Zealand pāua (abalone) fisheries,
  * assessment of the impact of fisheries on Pacific Ocean whale shark and oceanic whitetip shark.

The role is offered as a permanent position, with salary depending on
experience.  To apply for this position, please send a cover letter (a maximum
of two pages), a curriculum vitae and examples of recent research outputs
(including code that you have developed) to [Philipp Neubauer](mailto:philipp@dragonfly.co.nz).
International applicants are asked to check their visa eligibility on the Immigration New Zealand website.

Applications close on Saturday, 14 March 2020.
