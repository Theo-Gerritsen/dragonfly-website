Laura is a fisheries scientist at Dragonfly. She is an experienced statistical
 modeller with a background in environmental biology.

<!--more-->

Before joining Dragonfly in 2018, Laura spent four years in New Caledonia at SPC
(Pacific Community) as a stock assessment scientist. She led the stock
assessment for yellowfin tuna in 2017 and the assessment for South Pacific
albacore in 2018. Laura developed status indicators for data-poor bycatch
species including sharks, billfish and rays.

Laura graduated with a MSc in fisheries science from the University of British
Columbia in Vancouver and is currently completing her PhD thesis. Her PhD
research used spatiotemporal models to document range shifts in tuna and
billfish in the Pacific. While at SPC, she used multivariate methods to map the
complex interactions between industrial tuna fisheries and artisanal reef
fisheries in Pacific nations.

Laura believes that scientists responsible for informing decision-makers should
think differently about communication:

> My role as a scientist is to not only do the best science I can, but also to
> reach diverse audiences. Even the best science won't make a difference if it is not well communicated
