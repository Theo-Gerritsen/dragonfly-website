We are looking for a fisheries scientist with data analysis and statistical
modelling skills to contribute to projects related to fisheries and their
environmental impacts (e.g., protected species bycatch) in New Zealand and
internationally.

The ideal candidate is excited about working in fisheries and marine ecology,
and is comfortable performing data analyses for fisheries problems across
different contexts. You will have a strong background in statistical modelling,
ideally with experience applying Bayesian methods.

Depending on experience, responsibilities in this role may include generating
summaries of fisheries-related data from databases, developing statistical models
of protected species bycatch, carrying out quantitative risk assessments, and 
conducting fisheries stock assessments. 

Candidates will have an M.Sc. with some research experience, or a Ph.D. in a
relevant field, such as fisheries, quantitative ecology, or statistics.
We encourage applications by recent graduates, but also value relevant work
experience. Māori have strong interests in New Zealand fisheries, and we encourage
applicants with strong relationships with Te Ao Māori. 

This role may require communication with a wide range of stakeholders, including
other researchers, non-government organisations, government agencies, and
industry representatives. We are looking for a thoughtful and effective
communicator, who is able to make their work relevant to a broad range of
audiences.  Communication skills will include the ability to produce
high-quality writing, including visually-striking and effective graphs.

Some of our recent fisheries projects include:

  * research on the impact of climate change on marine ecosystems,
  * estimation of marine mammal bycatch,
  * risk assessment of the impact of surface-longline fishing on seabirds,
  * developing spatial models for New Zealand pāua (abalone) fisheries,
  * assessment of the impact of fisheries on Pacific Ocean whale shark and oceanic whitetip shark.

The role is offered as a permanent position, with salary depending on
experience.  To apply for this position, please send a cover letter (a maximum
of two pages), and a curriculum vitae to [Philipp Neubauer](mailto:philipp@dragonfly.co.nz).

Because of COVID-19, applicants must be eligible
to live and work in New Zealand. Please note that a similar role was advertised
before the pandemic, and we were unable to proceed. If you wish to be reconsidered,
please resubmit your application. 

Applications close at 12 pm on Monday, 21 September 2020.
