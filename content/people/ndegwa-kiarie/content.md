Kiarie is an engineer with a background in machine learning, experimental
laser physics and electronics engineering.

Before joining Dragonfly he worked as a senior data scientist at
[CSIRO](https://www.csiro.au/en/), applying machine learning to networked data.
This had wide-ranging uses from detecting fraud in large transactional networks
 to extracting information from complex patterns in social networks such as
 Twitter. Their previous role was at Xero, applying natural language
 processing and computer vision systems to financial data.

Kiarie moved to Canberra from Nairobi in Kenya as a teenager and has a
bachelor’s degree in electronics and telecommunications engineering from
Australian National University. He stayed to complete a master’s degree in
computer science, specialising in machine learning.

> I think we're on the cusp of being able to build systems that make the
benefits of the internet accessible to everyone regardless of their age,
ability, language or region. This will only happen through the use of
technologies based on machine learning. It's an exciting time to be in data
science, playing an active part in achieving this monumental goal.
