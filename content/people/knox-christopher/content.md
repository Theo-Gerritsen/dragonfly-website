Christopher is a web and software developer who specialises in data visualisation
– presenting large amounts of data in a graphical form.

Christopher enjoys being able to show clients their data in a way
that helps them make discoveries and solve real problems. 
Data visualisation leverages people's ability to rapidly hone 
in on relevant details, spot trends and isolate an issue. Christopher believes it 
is very efficient way to communicate information between analysts 
and decision makers. 

Creating visualisations draws on Christopher’s background in science and 
software development, enabling him to design and structure information in a 
scalable away. A recent project that had 28,000 possible views was built with 
robust automated systems and architecture that gave him confidence that every 
view would be correct. It was released to the public in a desktop format as well as 
an app. 

Christopher has a PhD in physical chemistry from the [University of Canterbury](http://www.chem.canterbury.ac.nz/) and completed two post-docs at the [University of California Irvine](http://uci.edu/). He then worked in software engineering at [NVIDIA](http://www.nvidia.com/content/global/global.php) in Finland followed by a position at the [King Abdullah University of Science and
Technology](http://www.kaust.edu.sa/), using visualisation to support research. He joined Dragonfly in 2013. 


> People love seeing their data presented visually, but because it looks so good, 
it’s easy to be led astray or distracted by a feature that’s actually irrelevant. At 
Dragonfly, we always rigorously analyse the data before presenting it, and 
continually refine our work to be sure that any patterns we see are in fact real.
