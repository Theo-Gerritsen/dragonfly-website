title: Seabirds on the menu

Dragonfly staff attended the New Zealand Marine Sciences
Society conference, held in Oban on Stewart Island from 5-8 July.

Getting to the island entailed travelling through Bluff, one of the
few places where sooty shearwater pies may be bought for lunch.

The population of Stewart Island is only 360 in the
winter, so the arrival of 150 scientists was noticeable around the
township.

Muttonbirds (sooty shearwater or titi) are a local delicacy and
around 350,000 are customarily taken from their burrows each year,
when the chicks are almost fledged. Sooty shearwaters are also caught
in trawl fisheries, and their numbers are now in decline. The sign
advertising muttonbird pies for sale in Bluff emphasizes the multiple
threats that seabirds face.

The conference was an intense three days of marine science. “It was
also good to have a yarn with the local blue cod fishers in the pub,
and they were keen to give us their views about things, including
seabird interactions, commented Edward. 

"We went on a charter trip
with Squizzy, on the Lo Loma, and had a good crowd of mollymawks and
albatrosses hanging around waiting for scraps."

“We also went over to Ulva Island, a pest-free bird sanctuary, and saw
yellowheads, tree creepers and lots of weka on the beach, says Yvan,
Dragonfly's keenest birder.

“Finlay and I went out looking for kiwi a couple of times.
Unfortunately those two nights we got soaked but saw nothing. Then
when I went out with Edward, we saw one wandering across the rugby
field just on the edge of town.”

The conference aimed to investigate opportunities to increase the
understanding of New Zealand’s marine environment and apply new
knowledge to its management and conservation.

Dragonfly staff gave the following presentations:

###Edward Abraham - Seabird bycatch in New Zealand fisheries.
An overview of the current status of knowledge of seabird bycatch in
New Zealand fisheries was presented. In recent years there has been an
increased focus by government and by the fishing industry on reducing
seabird bycatch in New Zealand fisheries.

This has included the use of a range of mitigation devices, an
increase in observer coverage in poorly observed fisheries and work
aimed at understanding the impact of fisheries bycatch on seabird
populations. The efficacy of measures aimed at reducing bycatch and
directions for future research was discussed.

###Yvan Richard - Risk of commercial fisheries to seabird populations
within the NZ EEZ.
New Zealand is a global centre of seabird diversity, and some studies
estimate a high number of seabirds are captured in commercial
fisheries within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The impact of
these captures on species viability depends on demographic parameters
such as population size, survival, and productivity.

The risk from bycatch in commercial trawl and longline fisheries for
64 New Zealand seabird species were examined. The black petrel
(*Procellaria parkinsoni*) clearly stood out as the species most at
risk from commercial fishing activities within the Exclusive Economic
Zone.

###Finlay Thompson - Common dolphin bycatch in New Zealand mackerel
trawl fisheries.
Observer coverage of the mackerel trawl fishery in New Zealand waters
between 1995 and 2009 allowed evaluation of common dolphin bycatch on
the North Island west coast. Observer data were used to develop a
statistical model to estimate total captures and to explore covariates
related to captures.

Over the 14-year study period, there were 108 common dolphin captures
reported by observers, with capture events frequently involving more
than one individual. In the 2008-09 season, an estimated 25 common
dolphins were captured in the mackerel trawl fishery.
