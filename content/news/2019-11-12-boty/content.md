title: Bird of the year data
---
The hoiho, or yellow-eyed penguin, took the 2019 crown in the New Zealand Bird
of the Year competition, but what about all the other birds? Forest and Bird
have released data on the votes cast, so that you can explore the voting in
detail.

[The confirmed vote dataset](/data/boty/BOTY-votes-2019.csv) 
is a comma separated value (CSV) file, suitable for loading into analysis or plotting software.  For each of the 43,460 confirmed votes,
the file gives the date of the vote, the hour of the vote, the country the vote
appeared to have been cast in (derived from the internet protocol address,
if the country could be determined), and the five preference votes in order
(vote 1, vote 2, vote 3, vote 4, and vote 5). The file includes macrons on the
common names, and is UTF-8 encoded. The data were prepared by [Yvan Richard](/people/richard-yvan.html) in
his role as scrutineer for the Bird of the Year competition. Thanks Yvan!
