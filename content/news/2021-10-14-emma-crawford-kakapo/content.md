title: Kākāpō Conservation on Whenua Hou
---
How much longer will New Zealand's abrupt treelines hold out against global warming?

Our newest team member, Emma Crawford, has had a passion for ecology for as long as she can remember. 
"When I was little I was always out in the garden lifting up logs and rocks, searching for insects 
and all sorts of creatures. It's funny, as an ecologist, I do the exact same thing now."

Emma has spent the majority of her career in the field working as a freelance ecologist, 
bouncing between the United Kingdom and New Zealand. Outside of work Emma enjoys photography, 
tramping and writing. Her and her partner’s blog, [Zoomology](https://zoom-ology.com/), 
captures their adventures and numerous encounters with wildlife across the globe.

As a Kiwi and an ecologist, Emma had always wanted to work with the endangered kākāpō. 
The opportunity, however, is a rare one, as the birds only breed after certain trees 
flower en masse producing large quantities of seed (otherwise known as a ‘mast’). 
On Whenua Hou, rimu masts trigger a breeding season.

Rimu masts result in the kākāpō’s food of choice, the rimu fruit, littering the forest floor, 
spurring the typically libidoless parrots into reproductive action. These masts, however, only 
occur every 2-4 to years, making them an infrequent yet crucial period for conservation efforts.

Finally, after a much anticipated wait, 2019 saw a ‘mega mast’ and Emma and her partner Tom were 
able to volunteer at Whenua Hou (otherwise known as Codfish Island). The Island, located south 
of Invercargill, acts as a predator-free sanctuary for many native New Zealand species, and holds 
the majority of the kākāpō breeding population.

“We applied to volunteer to help with the supplementary feed-out. During the two weeks we were on 
Whenua Hou, we tramped around the island each day cleaning and refilling feed stations to ensure 
that all the birds were getting suitable nutrition for breeding.”

Despite spending an entire two weeks in the kākāpō capital, Emma only spotted two of the elusive parrots
“all of our hundreds of other kākāpō sightings ended with a disappointed sigh of, “Oh, it’s just a ball 
of moss…” No offence to any bryologists out there!”
