A marae at Te Aurere in Northland was the setting for the 2019 Māori data futures hui held earlier this year. A combination of the place, history and the personalities who were there made it a particularly rich experience for Caleb Moses.

“We focussed on intellectual property and discussed kaitiakitanga (care) and questions about how to maintain sovereignty over our data”, says Caleb. “If we’re collecting information about our culture for example, how can we make the data useful but prevent it being misused or handed over to a corporation?”

The hui was co-hosted by Te Hiku Media and attended by about 40 people, including Māori data professionals, lawyers and others with an interest in data.

The location was special, as it’s where Tā Hekenukumai Busby “star navigation expert and all round legend in those parts” teaches from. Caleb says he and some contemporaries were the ones who revived the traditional knowledge of navigating using the night sky.  

“Tā Hekenukumai has a star compass on the hill there that that looks out over the beach. Although he’s now in his 80s, he showed us all how it works. When we were there, 20 students from Hawai’i were at the marae learning with Nainoa Thompson who rode on the [Hōkūleʻa](http://www.hokulea.com/education-at-sea/polynesian-navigation/the-star-compass/), which has been navigating by the stars for 40 years.

Being based in Auckland has given Caleb ready access to other local events, including the [AI-Day](https://www.ai-day.com/ai-day-2019) convention. The many talks about voice-assisted technology (especially chat bots) were a highlight.

“We heard from [Aider](https://www.aider.ai/) a New Zealand company that’s a tool for managing small business as well as iFLYTEK from China who do voice recognition at scale – about 1 billion requests per day. AI makes a lot of sense in that setting because it does scale. Their demo of a live translation from Chinese to English was great. I’ll be very excited when we get to do something like that in te reo!”
