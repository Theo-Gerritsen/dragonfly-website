title: Seabird bycatch data goes public
---

Fisheries observer data on the capture of seabirds in New Zealand
trawl and longline fisheries from 2002&ndash;03 to 2010&ndash;11 have
recently been made available through a web interface. 

The website was
developed by Dragonfly for the Ministry for Primary Industries
and is searchable by year, species, region and fishing method, with
results displayed in a clear graphical format.

The data have also been
provided and can be exported, for those who want to analyse it
themselves, or who want to use the data for other purposes.

Example pages include the capture of [New Zealand white-capped
albatross in squid trawl
fisheries](http://data.dragonfly.co.nz/psc/v20121101/white-capped-albatross/squid-trawl/all-vessels/eez/all/),
showing a decline in capture rates since the introduction of mandatory
warp mitigation in January 2006; or [black petrel captures in
bottom-longline
fisheries](http://data.dragonfly.co.nz/psc/v20121101/black-petrel/bottom-longline/all-vessels/eez/all/),
showing observed captures centered on the Hauraki Gulf.
In addition to reporting observed captures, estimates of total seabird
captures were made at the species level for sooty shearwater,
white-chinned petrel, and white-capped albatross. Estimates of total
captures were also generated for captures of other albatrosses and
other birds.

“Having this information out there in the public domain is something I
feel quite strongly about. This is information that potentially has
high public interest and should help inform the debate about seabird
bycatch,” says Edward.

The release of the data was enabled by  [NZGOAL](https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/),
the New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing framework, which
seeks to make government  data available so that it can be re-used.

In essence, this allows the data to be used for any other purpose and
republished, provided that attribution is given. Similarly, the
graphics from the site may be used in publications or in other
contexts, provided that appropriate attribution  is given.
