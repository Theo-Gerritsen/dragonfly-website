Māori Television’s Native Affairs programme has highlighted [Kōkako](https://kokako.co), Dragonfly’s
technology for monitoring the proportion of Māori language broadcast on iwi radio stations.
Wena Harawira from the Native Affairs team visited the Dragonfly office to talk to Edward about 
the technology that classifies the radio broadcast by whether they are talking in Te 
Reo Māori or English, or playing music. Kōkako was commissioned by Te Māngai Pāho (New Zealand’s 
Māori broadcasting agency) to replace a labour intensive, manual monitoring system. Edward also 
talks about the Dragonfly team’s commitment to learning Te Reo Māori.

The Kōkako website combines innovative use of machine learning with an
attractive user interface, developed by Wellington digital brand agency [Salted
Herring](https://www.saltedherring.com/). This design has received some
attention, with Kōkako selected as a finalist in the Interactive Applications
section of the Designers Institute of New Zealand [NZ Best Design
Awards](http://bestawards.co.nz/entries/interactive/kokako-language-tracking/).
