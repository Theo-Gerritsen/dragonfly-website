title: Curiosity uncovers election hack
---
Routine monitoring of the Bird of the Year election by Yvan Richard uncovered
illegal voting in the competition last week. The discovery was picked up by
media worldwide and “ruffled a few feathers” in New Zealand as well.

Yvan was tracking the votes by bird in the Forest & Bird election by scraping
the online results. He became suspicious when he noticed that votes for the
white-faced heron had shot up by 100 overnight.

“I saw the big spike so made contact with the competition organiser, Kimberley
Collins. We checked it out and found that all the votes had come from the same
IP address, and the email addresses were probably automatically generated, rather
than belonging to different people.”

The fraudulent votes have since been removed, but media attention from the
hacking story increased votes for the competition overall as well as for the
heron.

Yvan says he has tracked various elections, including Brexit and the 2016 US
election.

“In an election it’s the final results that matter. But you can sometimes get
surprises by watching the votes as they come in – it turns a static
process into exciting viewing. Personally, I think it’s better than watching
cricket on TV!”

Yvan says he uses the computer to capture the election data at a predetermined
interval and displays it in a useful form for plotting.

“Presenting data in a suitable format is what we do a lot at Dragonfly –
extracting, processing and dealing with messy data. I also find it intriguing to
look for clues to explain why a trend is changing.”

So which bird did Yvan vote for?

“The New Zealand robin, since did my PhD on them. Unfortunately the black petrel
was not part of the competition this year – our seabirds were definitely
under-represented. People are more emotionally connected to the birds they see
around them, but many of our seabirds are facing just as significant threats as
our land birds.”
