In November 2020, Edward brought in Finlay Thompson and Philipp Neubauer as
fellow directors. Finlay is now also the chief executive, responsible for the
day-to-day management of the company.

Edward started Dragonfly in 2006 when he began contract analysis work for the
Ministry for Primary Industries. Finlay was the first employee, joining
Dragonfly in 2008, and Phil joined the team in 2013. 

"We've worked together for a long time and are a very stable team. This move has
made the company more sustainable and is setting us up for further growth.  As
the scale of the company grows, so does the responsibility, and it’s better for
that to be shared than held by one person."

Edward says the new structure has established a precedent for the future and
frees him up to do a bit more work as well. 

"I’m pleased to have made the transition. We're now at 19 staff plus our
associates. It's very satisfying to have been able to employ people as we’ve
grown, and we will continue to do so."
