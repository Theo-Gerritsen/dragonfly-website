title: Southern Hemisphere seabird bycatch estimated
---
An international team of scientists recently completed a comprehensive analysis
of seabird bycatch in Southern Hemisphere tuna surface longline fisheries. It was
carried out at the final workshop in a multi-year Common Oceans ABNJ Tuna
Project run by Birdlife on behalf of the Food and Agriculture Organisation.

The workshop at Kruger National Park in South Africa involved about 30 people
from countries that included Japan, South Africa, Korea, Taiwan, Uruguay,
Australia and Brazil. Dr Igor Debski from the Department of Conservation 
and Edward were there from New Zealand as part of the technical team.

“During the workshop we developed an estimate of total seabird bycatch for the
Southern Hemisphere, for surface longline fisheries operating south of 20 South.
As the workshop we compiled one of the best
datasets of observer data on seabird bycatch that has been compiled. The dataset could only be worked on for the
duration of the workshop so the analysis was necessarily limited, but we had
three teams trying to calculate total bycatch using different methods and we all came up
with similar estimates.”

Edward says one of the teams calculated the bycatch using only information
published in the literature (rather than observed data) that was applied across
the different regions. It also lined up with the data-based methods.

“It was good to be able to share what we are doing in New Zealand – our analysis
methods are relatively sophisticated. I think that’s
because of the amazing diversity of our seabirds. We have 40 or 50 species
turning up in our bycatch, so we’ve had to develop methods to characterise that.”

A report on the workshop and the estimate will be published by the FAO in due
course. But Edward says the real outcomes are the relationships and the capacity
building that the project has enabled, as well as the encouragement for
countries fishing in the Southern Hemisphere to collect better data. 

“We met in Vietnam and now South Africa, and a group from Japan is coming to
Dragonfly next week to do further work to write up the results for the
[Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna](https://www.ccsbt.org/). 
I also expect to see analyses based on the
knowledge we’ve shared turning up from these countries at the tuna regional
fisheries management organisations to inform future decision-making.”

After the workshop, Edward and Igor had a few days to enjoy the local wildlife
including lions, elephant, giraffe, hyena and impala. As an expert birder, Igor
was able to point out some of the 500 species that can be found in the national
park.
