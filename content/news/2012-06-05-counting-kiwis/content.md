title: Counting kiwis

Simon Morton spoke to Stu Cockburn from the Department of Conservation and Edward from Dragonfly
about their project monitoring North Island brown kiwi in the
Rimutaka Forest Park on *This Way Up*, Radio New Zealand National. Susan Ellis from the Rimutaka Forest Park Trust was also interviewed.

Remote digital recorders in the area collect huge amounts of data, and
Dragonfly are working on software to help identify the kiwi calls. The
idea is that the calls will be able to be extracted, and then verified
by a human listener, using a web interface.  The archive of calls will
be used for the long term monitoring of the reintroduced kiwi
population.
