title: US fish stock assessments reviewed
---
Phil Neubauer recently published an analysis of the factors that lead to fish
species being formally assessed in a stock assessment process. The work involved
several collaborators from the United States including [NOAA
Fisheries](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/welcome), the government agency
responsible for the stewardship of the country’s ocean resources.

They found that even after accounting for price effects and the volume of fish
landed, there was still residual variation due to size – larger fish were
more likely to be assessed.

“One of the reasons we looked at US fisheries was because we had a very
comprehensive data set. It was compiled by one of the co-authors, Mike
Melnychuk, from the University of Washington. He has surveyed fisheries managers
and fisheries scientists for many years to understand fisheries stock assessments and
their economic context,” says Phil.

Phil has been working on the project for several years, and says it ended up
being a lot more complicated that he imagined at the start.

“We had the database for all the things that were being assessed, but trying to
figure out what species weren’t being assessed was hard. In the end we
used a national landings database that NOAA has maintained since the 1950s. It’s
pretty huge and contains everything that ever came up onto a fishing boat and
was reported, including alligators!”

The analysis used a statistical model to study 569 coastal fish and invertebrate
stocks from commercial fisheries. It considered the impacts of region, habitat,
life-history and economics on the probability of a new fishery being assessed.

Other research has proven the value of stock assessments, with stocks that are
assessed generally being in a better state than those that are not.

“The findings are also relevant for New Zealand. We don’t often stand back and
take a scientific look at the whole fisheries management framework, so to do
this kind of meta analysis is very interesting. It’s useful to be able to
identify what factors drive success in fisheries management.”
