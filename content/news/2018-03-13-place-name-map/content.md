title: Putting Māori place names on the map
---
A map of New Zealand studded with red and blue dots – red for a place with a Māori name and blue for a place with an English name – is one output from the three students who were based at Dragonfly last summer.

Max Bunting and William Asiata developed a programme to recognise te reo Māori and English words, which was used to create the map. They also analysed the use of Māori in Hansard, the written record of parliamentary debates.

Their work is contributing to a long-term project to develop Māori voice recognition software with (Te Hiku Radio)[https://tehiku.nz/te-hiku-radio/] and create a Māori-speaking Siri for use on digital devices.

Self-confessed technophobe Naomi Middleton compiled a body of modern Māori text from different sources (like Hansard), which is being used to help guide the voice recognition work.

“We need to check the output against good examples of written Māori, so there’s real value in having verified text to work from.

“I whakapapa to Te Mahurehure in the Hokianga on my mum’s side, which is not far from where the radio station is based. It’s a lovely connection and an opportunity for me to get to know the guys from Te Hiku and learn more about what’s happening in the world of te reo Māori at the moment.”

Both William and Max are students at the University of Auckland. In 2017 Max completed his second year of study towards a bachelor of science in maths and physics. William, a Samoan New Zealander, is studying towards a Master of Information Technology.

A grant from (Ka Hao: Māori Digital Technology Development Fund)[https://www.tpk.govt.nz/en/whakamahia/maori-digital-technology-development-fund] and sponsorship from (Te Pūnaha Matatini)[http://www.tepunahamatatini.ac.nz/] made the internships possible.
