title: Partnership for Papa Reo
---
Te Hiku Media, supported by Dragonfly, have received an investment of $13 million through
MBIE's Strategic Science Investment Fund to develop a multilingual language
platform, Papa Reo. Papa Reo will develop natural language processing tools,
starting with te reo Māori.

Formed in 1991, [Te Hiku Media](https://tehiku.nz) is an organisation committed
to the revitalisation of tikanga and te reo Māori. In 2013, kaumātua from Ngāti
Kuri, Te Aupōuri, Ngāi Takoto, Te Rarawa and Ngāti Kahu encouraged Te Hiku Media
to pursue technological innovation and secure a digital future for te reo Māori.  

Dragonfly are supporting this vision: 
“We are delighted to be able to work with Te Hiku Media to make tools like
speech recognition available in te reo Māori, with the ambition of inspiring
indigenous languages worldwide,” says Edward. 

“The funding will also support students and young researchers who are interested
in applying machine learning to languages, helping New Zealand build up
capability in this rapidly developing area.”

Alongside New Zealand-based academics and experts in linguistics, te reo Māori
and machine learning, the investment will allow for the collaboration to extend
beyond Aotearoa, bringing in critical global expertise including Cambridge
University’s Speech Group and Oxford University academics. A unique
collaboration for the project is with the machine learning group at Mozilla, a
non-profit tech company known for the Firefox web browser.

Peter Lucas Jones of Te Hiku Media says that Wellington-based Dragonfly Data
Science was engaged during the Kōrero Māori project to support Te Hiku Media
with the development of speech tools for te reo Māori. “Dragonfly specialises in
the application of machine learning and statistical analysis, and their
expertise in data science makes them a key partner for Papa Reo.”

The tools will enable applications to be built to ensure all New Zealanders can
use te reo Māori when engaging with their digital devices. New Zealand English
and Pacific languages will also be included to further support the growth of a
multilingual Aotearoa.

In a media release, Dr Megan Woods, Minister of Research, Science and Innovation
said that the four projects were chosen on excellence, and would help New
Zealand to address some of our greatest challenges like bringing Te Reo into
everyday digital interactions, and building a picture of climatic and ecological
trends.  

Papa Reo will build Aotearoa’s data science capability in machine learning and
data stewardship through kaitiakitanga. The project team includes relationships
with academic institutions who will provide supervision for PhD students and
post-doctoral fellowships. We look forward to hearing from people interested in
machine learning, artificial intelligence and te reo Māori.
