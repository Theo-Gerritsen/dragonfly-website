title: Indigenous Protocols and Artificial Intelligence

Caleb Moses recently spent time in Hawaiʻi at an indigenous AI workshop, as part of
a New Zealand group led by Peter-Lucas Jones and Keoni Mahelona from [Te Hiku Media](https://tehiku.nz/).

About 30 people from a wide range of backgrounds also attended – including
software engineers in big companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook – as well
as artists and activists. According to Caleb, the aim of the workshop was to
“put a bunch of smart people in one place and start talking together about what
indigenous AI could look like.” 

People at the AI workshop were excited to learn about the work that
[Te Hiku Media](https://tehiku.nz/) have been leading, to create a speech
recognition system for Te Reo Māori.

“A lot of people were inspired (to put it mildly) by the work we’d done”, he
says. “In terms of indigenous language, there isn’t anything similar going on
overseas just yet. I learned that other indigenous cultures look to Māori as an
example of indigenous cultural preservation. If you put our work in a broader
context, it becomes clear how important it is.” 

The workshop discussions were guided by questions like: from an indigenous
perspective, what should our relationship with AI be, and how could the role of
technology in society become broader than the culturally homogenous research
labs and Silicon Valley start-up culture?

“My feeling is that the potential of AI for social harm is already quite well
covered in public discussions. For example, we don’t want unethical smart
policing but we do want better health outcomes. 

“I’m particularly interested in how we can use AI to create new repositories for
indigenous knowledge. Automated speech recognition for te reo Māori is an
example of that – it expresses indigenous culture and language and exists to
help tangata whenua.”

Caleb also joined Peter-Lucas and Keoni at the [International Conference on Language
Documentation & Conservation](https://icldc6.weebly.com/), where they presented
te reo Māori speech recognition work in a talk called ‘Kaitiakitanga:
community-led guardianship and automatic speech recognition for Te Reo Māori’. 

“It was fascinating to be in Hawaiʻi – I particularly enjoyed learning about
their culture and colonial history. Fortunately I made friends with Dr Noelani
Arista at the AI workshop – she’s a native Kanaka Māoli history professor from the
University of Hawaiʻi at Manoa – who shared some great insights and answered my
many questions.”

He says one insight was hearing about the archive of newspapers from as early as
1834, in which the Kanaka Māoli documented their collective knowledge and
satisfied their curiosity for the outside world.

“One had a big picture of an elephant on page 2 and lots of detailed information
about where they live and what they eat, like an encyclopedia. The newspapers
also contain important cultural knowledge like funeral chants, which people are
still practicing today.”

Caleb says the newspapers are an example of the different types of data and
information repositories that exist for indigenous knowledge. He also said it
was interesting to see and hear about different international perspectives on
how knowledge can be cared for and used. 

“In New Zealand we focus a lot on how we can make things better here and because
of that I think we tend to be ahead of the curve, especially in indigenous
matters.”
