Edward and Finlay talk to Alison Ballance from *Our Changing World*, Radio New Zealand
National about their analysis of seabird and marine mammal bycatch
data collected by observers on fishing vessels. 

The data informed the Ministry for Primary Industries' National Plan of Action for Seabirds 2013, which aims to ensure that ‘New Zealand seabirds thrive without pressure from fishing related mortalities, New Zealand fishers avoid or mitigate against seabird captures and New Zealand fisheries are globally recognised as seabird friendly.’
