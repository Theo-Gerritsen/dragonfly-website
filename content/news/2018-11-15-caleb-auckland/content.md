 “Ed took me on knowing that I wanted to move north in the near future, which I
 really appreciated. It’s not just a good move for me personally but it’s also
 an opportunity for Dragonfly to have a presence in Auckland and make new
 connections there,” he says.

Caleb will be based at [Te Pūnaha Matatini](https://www.tepunahamatatini.ac.nz/)
three days a week, initially supervising the two summer interns, Max Bunting and
William Asiata, who spent the summer at Dragonfly last year. The three will
continue work on the Te Hiku Media Kōrero Māori project – applying machine
learning to transcribing spoken Māori.

“We appreciate Te Punaha’s hospitality very much and look forward to exchanging
ideas and expertise with them.”

Before he goes, Caleb will give at talk at the [Linguistic Society of New
Zealand’s conference](https://www.nzlingsoc.org/conference/conference-2018/) in
Wellington on 15 November called, ‘How to train your indigenous language speech
recognition engine.’
