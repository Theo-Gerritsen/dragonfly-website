Data for sea lion pup production and tag-resight studies.

<!--more-->

Researchers from the Conservation Services Programme at the Department of Conservation (DOC) carry out annual estimates of the total sea lion pup production from breeding sites in the Auckland Islands.

We created a website to summarise the results of these estimates and make the raw observational data available for download. Data from 2002â€“2012 is available.

DOC also monitors the population of New Zealand sea lions, which is about 10,000 individuals. Tagging and resighting studies of sea lions in the subantarctic are carried out as part of the monitoring programme to better understand their demographics. Data from 1979 to the present day is available.
