title: Fisheries Scientist—Statistical Modelling
---
We are looking for someone with excellent statistical modelling skills 
to work on and lead projects related to
fisheries and their environmental impacts. Sustainable management of
fisheries depends on informed decision making. You will be providing technical
advice to ensure that fisheries are well-run, sustainable, and of
low impact. You will be joining our team in Wellington, New Zealand.

## The role
We seek a fisheries or environmental scientist who is comfortable developing
Bayesian statistical models and using them to analyse data. Experience at complex
models, such as fisheries stock-assessment models, or spatio-temporal models 
will be required. 
Our linux-based toolchain revolves around
open-source software such as R, Python, PostgresSQL, etc., and we would prefer a
person who has actively coded used these tools.
Experience with Bayesian software such as Stan, JAGS, or Template Model Builder,  
would be ideal. 

A Ph.D. in a relevant field and postdoctoral experience are desirable.  At
minimum, candidates must have an M.Sc. in a relevant field, such as fisheries,
quantitative marine ecology, seabird or marine mammal bycatch, or applied statistics.
At M.Sc. level, demonstration of relevant research experience post-M.Sc. will be
required.

This work requires communication with a wide range of stakeholders, including
other researchers, non-government organisations, government agencies, and
industry representatives. We are looking for a thoughtful and considerate
communicator who is able to make their work relevant to a broad range of people. 

Through this job, the successful person will develop into a well-rounded
researcher who will be employable in any market, academic, government or
private, and we seek to provide an environment to achieve this. There is room to
contribute to existing projects and proposals, take over projects, develop new
streams of research, or seek funding to continue existing streams of work. 

The role is offered as a full-time permanent position, with salary depending on
experience, and five weeks annual leave. Usual terms and conditions under New
Zealand labour law apply.  We anticipate that the role will be based in
Wellington, and applicants must be eligible to work in New Zealand.
We can offer flexible working arrangements, if required, that may suit people
with young families. For example, some of our staff live semi-rurally and work
partly from home. 

## Working at dragonfly

Dragonfly Data Science ([www.dragonfly.co.nz](http://www.dragonfly.co.nz)) 
are a small consultancy.  We are a collaborative team, taking pride in
our ability to work together, and draw on substantial expertise in a range of
domains. While individuals are  responsible for particular projects, outputs are
products of our teamwork.  This role will suit a curious, open-minded and
optimistic person, who is willing to take advantage of new opportunities as they
arise. We strongly encourage applications  from Māori, from women, or from
people who will add to the diversity of our team.

Dragonfly Data Science works with a broad range of clients, with new
opportunities presenting regularly in fields from fisheries, to genomics,
language modelling, and reproducible research. We are ambitious, and taking
advantage of these opportunities means we need someone to help with aspects of
our fisheries work. 

Some relevant fisheries projects that we are currently working on include:
risk assessment of the impact of fishing on New Zealand seabird and marine mammal populations;
research on the impact of climate change on marine ecosystems;
developing spatial models for New Zealand pāua fisheries; and 
assessment of the impact of fisheries on Pacific whale-sharks.

While most of our research is applied, we support fundamental science projects
that can complement and inform our other work. The successful candidate will be
encouraged to publish their work, as well as build and maintain relationships
with new and previous colleagues in New Zealand and overseas. 


## Application

Please send a cover-letter (a maximum of two pages), a curriculum vitae including 
the names of three referees, and examples of recent research outputs to Louise Alliston
([louise@dragonfly.co.nz](mailto:louise@dragonfly.co.nz)).
Applications close at the end of Friday, February 23rd, 2018.
