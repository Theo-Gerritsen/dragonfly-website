title: Going deep on Māori language
---
Developer and data scientist Miles Thompson recently started working with
Dragonfly on the Kōrero Māori project – applying machine learning to
transcribing spoken Māori.

Miles has worked off and on in machine learning throughout his career and is now
relishing the opportunity to focus on it in a more full time capacity.

While in New York, he worked with big data and C# programming in his main job
but also did some other data science and python work, including machine
learning.

“Recently I was involved in creating a theatre production that used a degree of
machine learning to create a different performance every night. In [The Great
Outdoors](http://goodbright.nz/assets/pdf/exploring_art_entropy.pdf), we
harvested recent comments on the internet and using machine learning, we found
and arranged comments that were then spoken in the performance. It was
fascinating to see my programming work presented in that setting.”

Miles’ day job for four years was chief technical officer for the financial
research provider CreditSights. After two children came along, he and his
partner moved back to New Zealand and Miles carried on working for the company
as a technical architect.

During those years he was involved in projects with Edward, including a venture
that incorporated machine learning and AI. Although he’d studied neural networks
at university, he hadn’t ever used them.

“It was a powerful approach but needed a few years for our hardware to catch up
with the algorithms. At that stage people had almost given up on machine
learning and neural networks because it was so difficult to get them to work.”

Then in 2014 he went along to a talk at Dragonfly (at the invitation of his
brother Finlay) given by [Marcus
Frean](https://ecs.victoria.ac.nz/Main/MarcusFrean) from Victoria University who
presented the latest techniques coming out of the University of Toronto. The
term ‘deep learning’ was coined around that time, to recognise this new, deeply
layered approach.

“It’s a bit like machine learning 2.0. We’re applying some of these new
techniques to the Kōrero Māori project, and iteratively improving the accuracy
of the model we’ve developed so far. Dragonfly are doing cutting edge work –
it’s a very exciting place to be. Things are changing rapidly in the area of
machine learning at the moment and we’re at the forefront of that.”

Dragonfly Data Science is a partner in Kōrero Māori, a project building speech
recognition software for te reo Māori, led by [Te Hiku Media](https://tehiku.nz/),
and supported by [Te Pūnaha Matatini](http://www.tepunahamatatini.ac.nz/). [Listen to a story

Miles is available for other data and machine learning projects and can be
