During the Christmas break, Edward digitised his slides from a trip to Campbell Island in 1996 and shared them on Flikr. The album has adorable images of fluffy albatross chicks at the Bull Rock colony.

“We appreciate being able to use images that other people make available via Creative Commons, so I thought I would do the same while I had some time,” he says.

One of New Zealand’s subantartcic islands, Campbell Island has a unique flora and fauna that includes Campbell albatross (also called Campbell black-browed mollymawk), eastern rockhopper penguins and megaherbs – unusually large flowering plants.

“What’s interesting about the trip is that I went as a volunteer to help Susan Waugh (now Senior Curator Sciences at Te Papa) with her PhD research on albatross. Later, Susan contacted me to do some analysis on seabird bycatch mitigation that ultimately led to me starting Dragonfly. The trip was really the start of my interest in albatross and bycatch.”
