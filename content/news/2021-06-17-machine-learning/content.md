title: Machine learning and deep learning

Kiarie Ndegwa recently joined Dragonfly from CSIRO in Canberra, Australia. He studied machine learning in his master’s degree and has used the technique in diverse settings to solve large, messy data problems.  Here, he explains the basics.

“Machine learning is a hot topic right now, but it’s is part of the bigger field of AI (artificial intelligence). AI is a set of tools that are used to create algorithms to solve problems. The algorithms mimic intelligence, which is essentially the ability to adapt, to have memory and to make decisions.”

Kiarie says the distinctive feature of machine learning is that it’s data-driven rather than human-driven.

“If we want to find images of cats or dogs in a set of images, for example, we don’t have to create a set of handcrafted rules to teach the model explicitly what a cat or dog looks like. Instead, we give a set of example images with cats and dogs and let it work out the unique identifying features of those animals itself.”

“In this ‘black box’ system we don’t know what features it will generate to tell cats and dogs apart. But if we could look inside, there would probably be a strong correlation with what we’d use to identify a dog or cat – fur, snouts, ears – as well as other weird non-intuitive features we don’t understand.

Kiarie explains that ‘deep learning’ is a type of machine learning. “Machine learning is a very rudimentary mimic of a mammalian neural network. So, the more neurons and data you have, the better your machine learning will work – it’s like having a bigger brain and more examples to learn from. The ‘deep’ refers to having multiple layers of simulated neurons in an artificial neural network.  

The ethical concerns around bias in machine learning are something that Kiarie is aware of, particularly in the ways it has been used by media and social media recently.

“If the dataset is biased because of the way data has been collected, the model will follow that bias and make it more explicit. This can enhance and perpetuate discrimination, so we have to be hyper-aware of ways we might be seeing or creating bias.

“If we’re creating a model that’s based on spoken language, for example, we have to make sure older voices are recognised as well as younger ones, and female as well as male. Otherwise, we will create an output that’s biased towards only one part of a population.”

Machine learning is coded in the Python programming language.

“Although there are libraries available, the algorithms we need usually have to be coded from scratch. Because they’re specific for the problem you’re trying to solve you can’t just pick one off the shelf. It’s an iterative process.

“At the moment there is lots of experimentation and tinkering going on in the field. I follow some practitioners on Twitter, as well as the mathematicians who are trying to validate the results. It’s an exciting time. Machine learning has the potential to crack some of today’s really challenging problems, like self-driving cars.”
