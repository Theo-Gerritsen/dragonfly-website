title: A big welcome back to Tim
---
In the space of 12 years, Tim McNamara has worked as a developer and data scientist, created multiple start-ups, got a Master’s degree, written a book on programming and begun giving online software tutorials. Now he’s re-joining Dragonfly to get back to data science and knowledge creation.

Tim first worked at Dragonfly back in 2011, when the team was much smaller and focussed on supporting government policy related to ecology.

“They’ve grown organically over 10 years and now seem to bridge pure research and commercial work, and sit at the intersection of quite a few fields. I think that’s really fascinating and a very nice space to be,” he says.

Tim was the first employee at Dot Loves Data 6 years ago – the business grew to a staff of more than 20 during his 4 years there. Most recently he has been working remotely for the international open source software firm [Canonical](https://canonical.com/), which develops the Ubuntu Linux operating system.

“I joined Canonical because I wanted to challenge myself and see whether or not I was really good at this software thing. It seems I did fine and remain on their ‘would re-hire’ list.”

Tim learned to code to support humanitarian causes. His first code contribution was to the [Sahana disaster management system](https://sahanafoundation.org/). He remains a voting member of the [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](https://www.hotosm.org/) and has been part of global disaster mapping efforts worldwide.

In early 2011, he helped set up the Christchurch Recovery Map after the Canterbury earthquakes. Using volunteers, the website made real-time information available like where people could access water and petrol and which schools or shops were open.  

Other work has included experience in using publicly available data to help government agencies and businesses find out how much impact their public profile is having.

“For me as a data scientist who’s involved in natural language processing, everything that’s public online is a potential source of data. Social media, search engine rankings and where published text appears can provide useful information given the right weightings and analysis.”

Tim is interested in broader issues related to the quality of data science and the maturation of the industry in New Zealand.

“Typically clients want data to give them confidence in making a decision about the right thing to do. I think the data community here is very cognisant of wanting to be helpful but ultimately they are all selling – they will tell you the solution is going to be amazing! One of the things I’d like to see (and haven’t yet) is a chief executive who asks me to explain the methodology behind our analysis – and what the flaws are – so they can justify the expenditure to the board.”

Tim has two young children, is about to give birth to a non-fiction book and if time allowed, he’d be training for his next ultramarathon.
