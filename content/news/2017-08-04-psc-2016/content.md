title: Protected species captures in New Zealand fisheries
---
The latest estimate of the number of seabirds, whales, dolphins, turtles, rays and sharks caught in New Zealand’s fisheries was released today. The Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) released the protected species capture data for the year ending September 2016 via a [Dragonfly website](https://psc.dragonfly.co.nz/2017v1/released/explore/).

The data is categorised by fishing method, species, region, vessel size and year with observed catches listed and estimated captures calculated.

Edward says, “The capture rates haven’t changed much but the total captures are going down and that’s what matters for the birds. I think fishing is becoming more efficient, so less fishing effort is required to catch the fish and that means overall, fishers are catching fewer birds.”   

The total estimated number of birds caught in the 2015–2016 year was 1695 – the lowest to date – and close to half of what it was in 2002–2003. Observer coverage of fishing activity has increased, mostly on large offshore vessels, which has reduced the uncertainty in the statistical analysis. More seabirds have also been released alive.

Observer coverage for the black petrel, the bird most at-risk from further population decline, has risen from a few percent to 15 percent this year.

“We now have a much better idea of what’s going on. There’s been a decline in capture rates, which is likely to be associated with a change in snapper fishing from summer to winter. The birds spend our winters in Central America so they simply aren’t around then.”

“Since we started this work MPI have released the data to the public, which promotes transparency, and we’ve it friendly and accessible from a phone. There’s a lot of interest – this year several NGOs published their own analysis of it.”
